### https://thejunglecan.com/

The Jungle Can’t Happen Here In Wonderland is a website and digital toy that collages random quotations from three classic works of literature. Each press of the snake compiles a trio of random excerpts, one from Upton Sinclair’s <i>The Jungle</i> (1906), Sinclair Lewis’s <i>It Can’t Happen Here</i> (1935), and Lewis Carroll’s <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> (1865), respectively.

This site was created by Holly Burdorff and Justin Linton in 2023.
