        "The Jungle\r\n\r\nby Upton Sinclair\r\n\r\n(1906)\r\n\r\nTO THE WORKINGMEN OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I\r\n CHAPTER II\r\n CHAPTER III\r\n CHAPTER IV\r\n CHAPTER V\r\n CHAPTER VI\r\n CHAPTER VII\r\n CHAPTER VIII\r\n CHAPTER IX\r\n CHAPTER X\r\n CHAPTER XI\r\n CHAPTER XII\r\n CHAPTER XIII\r\n CHAPTER XIV\r\n CHAPTER XV\r\n CHAPTER XVI\r\n CHAPTER XVII\r\n CHAPTER XVIII\r\n CHAPTER XIX\r\n CHAPTER XX\r\n CHAPTER XXI\r\n CHAPTER XXII\r\n CHAPTER XXIII\r\n CHAPTER XXIV\r\n CHAPTER XXV\r\n CHAPTER XXVI\r\n CHAPTER XXVII\r\n CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n CHAPTER XXIX\r\n CHAPTER XXX\r\n CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was four o’clock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began\r\nto arrive.",
        "There had been a crowd following all the way, owing to the\r\nexuberance of Marija Berczynskas.",
        "The occasion rested heavily upon\r\nMarija’s broad shoulders—it was her task to see that all things went in\r\ndue form, and after the best home traditions; and, flying wildly hither\r\nand thither, bowling every one out of the way, and scolding and\r\nexhorting all day with her tremendous voice, Marija was too eager to\r\nsee that others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself.",
        "She had left the church last of all, and, desiring to arrive first at\r\nthe hall, had issued orders to the coachman to drive faster.",
        "When that\r\npersonage had developed a will of his own in the matter, Marija had\r\nflung up the window of the carriage, and, leaning out, proceeded to\r\ntell him her opinion of him, first in Lithuanian, which he did not\r\nunderstand, and then in Polish, which he did.",
        "Having the advantage of\r\nher in altitude, the driver had stood his ground and even ventured to\r\nattempt to speak; and the result had been a furious altercation, which,\r\ncontinuing all the way down Ashland Avenue, had added a new swarm of\r\nurchins to the cortege at each side street for half a mile.",
        "This was unfortunate, for already there was a throng before the door.",
        "The music had started up, and half a block away you could hear the dull\r\n“broom, broom” of a cello, with the squeaking of two fiddles which vied\r\nwith each other in intricate and altitudinous gymnastics.",
        "Seeing the\r\nthrong, Marija abandoned precipitately the debate concerning the\r\nancestors of her coachman, and, springing from the moving carriage,\r\nplunged in and proceeded to clear a way to the hall.",
        "Once within, she\r\nturned and began to push the other way, roaring, meantime, “_Eik!",
        "Eik!",
        "Uzdaryk-duris!_” in tones which made the orchestral uproar sound like\r\nfairy music.",
        "“Z.",
        "Graiczunas, Pasilinksminimams darzas.",
        "Vynas.",
        "Sznapsas.",
        "Wines and\r\nLiquors.",
        "Union Headquarters”—that was the way the signs ran.",
        "The\r\nreader, who perhaps has never held much converse in the language of\r\nfar-off Lithuania, will be glad of the explanation that the place was\r\nthe rear room of a saloon in that part of Chicago known as “back of the\r\nyards.” This information is definite and suited to the matter of fact;\r\nbut how pitifully inadequate it would have seemed to one who understood\r\nthat it was also the supreme hour of ecstasy in the life of one of\r\nGod’s gentlest creatures, the scene of the wedding feast and the\r\njoy-transfiguration of little Ona Lukoszaite!",
        "She stood in the doorway, shepherded by Cousin Marija, breathless from\r\npushing through the crowd, and in her happiness painful to look upon.",
        "There was a light of wonder in her eyes and her lids trembled, and her\r\notherwise wan little face was flushed.",
        "She wore a muslin dress,\r\nconspicuously white, and a stiff little veil coming to her shoulders.",
        "There were five pink paper roses twisted in the veil, and eleven bright\r\ngreen rose leaves.",
        "There were new white cotton gloves upon her hands,\r\nand as she stood staring about her she twisted them together\r\nfeverishly.",
        "It was almost too much for her—you could see the pain of\r\ntoo great emotion in her face, and all the tremor of her form.",
        "She was\r\nso young—not quite sixteen—and small for her age, a mere child; and she\r\nhad just been married—and married to Jurgis,[1] of all men, to Jurgis\r\nRudkus, he with the white flower in the buttonhole of his new black\r\nsuit, he with the mighty shoulders and the giant hands.",
        "[1] Pronounced _Yoorghis_\r\n\r\n\r\nOna was blue-eyed and fair, while Jurgis had great black eyes with\r\nbeetling brows, and thick black hair that curled in waves about his\r\nears—in short, they were one of those incongruous and impossible\r\nmarried couples with which Mother Nature so often wills to confound all\r\nprophets, before and after.",
        "Jurgis could take up a\r\ntwo-hundred-and-fifty-pound quarter of beef and carry it into a car\r\nwithout a stagger, or even a thought; and now he stood in a far corner,\r\nfrightened as a hunted animal, and obliged to moisten his lips with his\r\ntongue each time before he could answer the congratulations of his\r\nfriends.",
        "Gradually there was effected a separation between the spectators and\r\nthe guests—a separation at least sufficiently complete for working\r\npurposes.",
        "There was no time during the festivities which ensued when\r\nthere were not groups of onlookers in the doorways and the corners; and\r\nif any one of these onlookers came sufficiently close, or looked\r\nsufficiently hungry, a chair was offered him, and he was invited to the\r\nfeast.",
        "It was one of the laws of the _veselija_ that no one goes\r\nhungry; and, while a rule made in the forests of Lithuania is hard to\r\napply in the stockyards district of Chicago, with its quarter of a\r\nmillion inhabitants, still they did their best, and the children who\r\nran in from the street, and even the dogs, went out again happier.",
        "A\r\ncharming informality was one of the characteristics of this\r\ncelebration.",
        "The men wore their hats, or, if they wished, they took\r\nthem off, and their coats with them; they ate when and where they\r\npleased, and moved as often as they pleased.",
        "There were to be speeches\r\nand singing, but no one had to listen who did not care to; if he\r\nwished, meantime, to speak or sing himself, he was perfectly free.",
        "The\r\nresulting medley of sound distracted no one, save possibly alone the\r\nbabies, of which there were present a number equal to the total\r\npossessed by all the guests invited.",
        "There was no other place for the\r\nbabies to be, and so part of the preparations for the evening consisted\r\nof a collection of cribs and carriages in one corner.",
        "In these the\r\nbabies slept, three or four together, or wakened together, as the case\r\nmight be.",
        "Those who were still older, and could reach the tables,\r\nmarched about munching contentedly at meat bones and bologna sausages.",
        "The room is about thirty feet square, with whitewashed walls, bare save\r\nfor a calendar, a picture of a race horse, and a family tree in a\r\ngilded frame.",
        "To the right there is a door from the saloon, with a few\r\nloafers in the doorway, and in the corner beyond it a bar, with a\r\npresiding genius clad in soiled white, with waxed black mustaches and a\r\ncarefully oiled curl plastered against one side of his forehead.",
        "In the\r\nopposite corner are two tables, filling a third of the room and laden\r\nwith dishes and cold viands, which a few of the hungrier guests are\r\nalready munching.",
        "At the head, where sits the bride, is a snow-white\r\ncake, with an Eiffel tower of constructed decoration, with sugar roses\r\nand two angels upon it, and a generous sprinkling of pink and green and\r\nyellow candies.",
        "Beyond opens a door into the kitchen, where there is a\r\nglimpse to be had of a range with much steam ascending from it, and\r\nmany women, old and young, rushing hither and thither.",
        "In the corner to\r\nthe left are the three musicians, upon a little platform, toiling\r\nheroically to make some impression upon the hubbub; also the babies,\r\nsimilarly occupied, and an open window whence the populace imbibes the\r\nsights and sounds and odors.",
        "Suddenly some of the steam begins to advance, and, peering through it,\r\nyou discern Aunt Elizabeth, Ona’s stepmother—Teta Elzbieta, as they\r\ncall her—bearing aloft a great platter of stewed duck.",
        "Behind her is\r\nKotrina, making her way cautiously, staggering beneath a similar\r\nburden; and half a minute later there appears old Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene, with a big yellow bowl of smoking potatoes, nearly as big\r\nas herself.",
        "So, bit by bit, the feast takes form—there is a ham and a\r\ndish of sauerkraut, boiled rice, macaroni, bologna sausages, great\r\npiles of penny buns, bowls of milk, and foaming pitchers of beer.",
        "There\r\nis also, not six feet from your back, the bar, where you may order all\r\nyou please and do not have to pay for it.",
        "“_Eiksz!",
        "Graicziau!_” screams\r\nMarija Berczynskas, and falls to work herself—for there is more upon\r\nthe stove inside that will be spoiled if it be not eaten.",
        "So, with laughter and shouts and endless badinage and merriment, the\r\nguests take their places.",
        "The young men, who for the most part have\r\nbeen huddled near the door, summon their resolution and advance; and\r\nthe shrinking Jurgis is poked and scolded by the old folks until he\r\nconsents to seat himself at the right hand of the bride.",
        "The two\r\nbridesmaids, whose insignia of office are paper wreaths, come next, and\r\nafter them the rest of the guests, old and young, boys and girls.",
        "The\r\nspirit of the occasion takes hold of the stately bartender, who\r\ncondescends to a plate of stewed duck; even the fat policeman—whose\r\nduty it will be, later in the evening, to break up the fights—draws up\r\na chair to the foot of the table.",
        "And the children shout and the babies\r\nyell, and every one laughs and sings and chatters—while above all the\r\ndeafening clamor Cousin Marija shouts orders to the musicians.",
        "The musicians—how shall one begin to describe them?",
        "All this time they\r\nhave been there, playing in a mad frenzy—all of this scene must be\r\nread, or said, or sung, to music.",
        "It is the music which makes it what\r\nit is; it is the music which changes the place from the rear room of a\r\nsaloon in back of the yards to a fairy place, a wonderland, a little\r\ncorner of the high mansions of the sky.",
        "The little person who leads this trio is an inspired man.",
        "His fiddle is\r\nout of tune, and there is no rosin on his bow, but still he is an\r\ninspired man—the hands of the muses have been laid upon him.",
        "He plays\r\nlike one possessed by a demon, by a whole horde of demons.",
        "You can feel\r\nthem in the air round about him, capering frenetically; with their\r\ninvisible feet they set the pace, and the hair of the leader of the\r\norchestra rises on end, and his eyeballs start from their sockets, as\r\nhe toils to keep up with them.",
        "Tamoszius Kuszleika is his name, and he has taught himself to play the\r\nviolin by practicing all night, after working all day on the “killing\r\nbeds.” He is in his shirt sleeves, with a vest figured with faded gold\r\nhorseshoes, and a pink-striped shirt, suggestive of peppermint candy.",
        "A\r\npair of military trousers, light blue with a yellow stripe, serve to\r\ngive that suggestion of authority proper to the leader of a band.",
        "He is\r\nonly about five feet high, but even so these trousers are about eight\r\ninches short of the ground.",
        "You wonder where he can have gotten them or\r\nrather you would wonder, if the excitement of being in his presence\r\nleft you time to think of such things.",
        "For he is an inspired man.",
        "Every inch of him is inspired—you might\r\nalmost say inspired separately.",
        "He stamps with his feet, he tosses his\r\nhead, he sways and swings to and fro; he has a wizened-up little face,\r\nirresistibly comical; and, when he executes a turn or a flourish, his\r\nbrows knit and his lips work and his eyelids wink—the very ends of his\r\nnecktie bristle out.",
        "And every now and then he turns upon his\r\ncompanions, nodding, signaling, beckoning frantically—with every inch\r\nof him appealing, imploring, in behalf of the muses and their call.",
        "For they are hardly worthy of Tamoszius, the other two members of the\r\norchestra.",
        "The second violin is a Slovak, a tall, gaunt man with\r\nblack-rimmed spectacles and the mute and patient look of an overdriven\r\nmule; he responds to the whip but feebly, and then always falls back\r\ninto his old rut.",
        "The third man is very fat, with a round, red,\r\nsentimental nose, and he plays with his eyes turned up to the sky and a\r\nlook of infinite yearning.",
        "He is playing a bass part upon his cello,\r\nand so the excitement is nothing to him; no matter what happens in the\r\ntreble, it is his task to saw out one long-drawn and lugubrious note\r\nafter another, from four o’clock in the afternoon until nearly the same\r\nhour next morning, for his third of the total income of one dollar per\r\nhour.",
        "Before the feast has been five minutes under way, Tamoszius Kuszleika\r\nhas risen in his excitement; a minute or two more and you see that he\r\nis beginning to edge over toward the tables.",
        "His nostrils are dilated\r\nand his breath comes fast—his demons are driving him.",
        "He nods and\r\nshakes his head at his companions, jerking at them with his violin,\r\nuntil at last the long form of the second violinist also rises up.",
        "In\r\nthe end all three of them begin advancing, step by step, upon the\r\nbanqueters, Valentinavyczia, the cellist, bumping along with his\r\ninstrument between notes.",
        "Finally all three are gathered at the foot of\r\nthe tables, and there Tamoszius mounts upon a stool.",
        "Now he is in his glory, dominating the scene.",
        "Some of the people are\r\neating, some are laughing and talking—but you will make a great mistake\r\nif you think there is one of them who does not hear him.",
        "His notes are\r\nnever true, and his fiddle buzzes on the low ones and squeaks and\r\nscratches on the high; but these things they heed no more than they\r\nheed the dirt and noise and squalor about them—it is out of this\r\nmaterial that they have to build their lives, with it that they have to\r\nutter their souls.",
        "And this is their utterance; merry and boisterous,\r\nor mournful and wailing, or passionate and rebellious, this music is\r\ntheir music, music of home.",
        "It stretches out its arms to them, they\r\nhave only to give themselves up.",
        "Chicago and its saloons and its slums\r\nfade away—there are green meadows and sunlit rivers, mighty forests and\r\nsnow-clad hills.",
        "They behold home landscapes and childhood scenes\r\nreturning; old loves and friendships begin to waken, old joys and\r\ngriefs to laugh and weep.",
        "Some fall back and close their eyes, some\r\nbeat upon the table.",
        "Now and then one leaps up with a cry and calls for\r\nthis song or that; and then the fire leaps brighter in Tamoszius’ eyes,\r\nand he flings up his fiddle and shouts to his companions, and away they\r\ngo in mad career.",
        "The company takes up the choruses, and men and women\r\ncry out like all possessed; some leap to their feet and stamp upon the\r\nfloor, lifting their glasses and pledging each other.",
        "Before long it\r\noccurs to some one to demand an old wedding song, which celebrates the\r\nbeauty of the bride and the joys of love.",
        "In the excitement of this\r\nmasterpiece Tamoszius Kuszleika begins to edge in between the tables,\r\nmaking his way toward the head, where sits the bride.",
        "There is not a\r\nfoot of space between the chairs of the guests, and Tamoszius is so\r\nshort that he pokes them with his bow whenever he reaches over for the\r\nlow notes; but still he presses in, and insists relentlessly that his\r\ncompanions must follow.",
        "During their progress, needless to say, the\r\nsounds of the cello are pretty well extinguished; but at last the three\r\nare at the head, and Tamoszius takes his station at the right hand of\r\nthe bride and begins to pour out his soul in melting strains.",
        "Little Ona is too excited to eat.",
        "Once in a while she tastes a little\r\nsomething, when Cousin Marija pinches her elbow and reminds her; but,\r\nfor the most part, she sits gazing with the same fearful eyes of\r\nwonder.",
        "Teta Elzbieta is all in a flutter, like a hummingbird; her\r\nsisters, too, keep running up behind her, whispering, breathless.",
        "But\r\nOna seems scarcely to hear them—the music keeps calling, and the\r\nfar-off look comes back, and she sits with her hands pressed together\r\nover her heart.",
        "Then the tears begin to come into her eyes; and as she\r\nis ashamed to wipe them away, and ashamed to let them run down her\r\ncheeks, she turns and shakes her head a little, and then flushes red\r\nwhen she sees that Jurgis is watching her.",
        "When in the end Tamoszius\r\nKuszleika has reached her side, and is waving his magic wand above her,\r\nOna’s cheeks are scarlet, and she looks as if she would have to get up\r\nand run away.",
        "In this crisis, however, she is saved by Marija Berczynskas, whom the\r\nmuses suddenly visit.",
        "Marija is fond of a song, a song of lovers’\r\nparting; she wishes to hear it, and, as the musicians do not know it,\r\nshe has risen, and is proceeding to teach them.",
        "Marija is short, but\r\npowerful in build.",
        "She works in a canning factory, and all day long she\r\nhandles cans of beef that weigh fourteen pounds.",
        "She has a broad Slavic\r\nface, with prominent red cheeks.",
        "When she opens her mouth, it is\r\ntragical, but you cannot help thinking of a horse.",
        "She wears a blue\r\nflannel shirt-waist, which is now rolled up at the sleeves, disclosing\r\nher brawny arms; she has a carving fork in her hand, with which she\r\npounds on the table to mark the time.",
        "As she roars her song, in a voice\r\nof which it is enough to say that it leaves no portion of the room\r\nvacant, the three musicians follow her, laboriously and note by note,\r\nbut averaging one note behind; thus they toil through stanza after\r\nstanza of a lovesick swain’s lamentation:—\r\n\r\n“Sudiev’ kvietkeli, tu brangiausis;\r\nSudiev’ ir laime, man biednam,\r\nMatau—paskyre teip Aukszcziausis,\r\nJog vargt ant svieto reik vienam!”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the song is over, it is time for the speech, and old Dede Antanas\r\nrises to his feet.",
        "Grandfather Anthony, Jurgis’ father, is not more\r\nthan sixty years of age, but you would think that he was eighty.",
        "He has\r\nbeen only six months in America, and the change has not done him good.",
        "In his manhood he worked in a cotton mill, but then a coughing fell\r\nupon him, and he had to leave; out in the country the trouble\r\ndisappeared, but he has been working in the pickle rooms at Durham’s,\r\nand the breathing of the cold, damp air all day has brought it back.",
        "Now as he rises he is seized with a coughing fit, and holds himself by\r\nhis chair and turns away his wan and battered face until it passes.",
        "Generally it is the custom for the speech at a _veselija_ to be taken\r\nout of one of the books and learned by heart; but in his youthful days\r\nDede Antanas used to be a scholar, and really make up all the love\r\nletters of his friends.",
        "Now it is understood that he has composed an\r\noriginal speech of congratulation and benediction, and this is one of\r\nthe events of the day.",
        "Even the boys, who are romping about the room,\r\ndraw near and listen, and some of the women sob and wipe their aprons\r\nin their eyes.",
        "It is very solemn, for Antanas Rudkus has become\r\npossessed of the idea that he has not much longer to stay with his\r\nchildren.",
        "His speech leaves them all so tearful that one of the guests,\r\nJokubas Szedvilas, who keeps a delicatessen store on Halsted Street,\r\nand is fat and hearty, is moved to rise and say that things may not be\r\nas bad as that, and then to go on and make a little speech of his own,\r\nin which he showers congratulations and prophecies of happiness upon\r\nthe bride and groom, proceeding to particulars which greatly delight\r\nthe young men, but which cause Ona to blush more furiously than ever.",
        "Jokubas possesses what his wife complacently describes as “poetiszka\r\nvaidintuve”—a poetical imagination.",
        "Now a good many of the guests have finished, and, since there is no\r\npretense of ceremony, the banquet begins to break up.",
        "Some of the men\r\ngather about the bar; some wander about, laughing and singing; here and\r\nthere will be a little group, chanting merrily, and in sublime\r\nindifference to the others and to the orchestra as well.",
        "Everybody is\r\nmore or less restless—one would guess that something is on their minds.",
        "And so it proves.",
        "The last tardy diners are scarcely given time to\r\nfinish, before the tables and the debris are shoved into the corner,\r\nand the chairs and the babies piled out of the way, and the real\r\ncelebration of the evening begins.",
        "Then Tamoszius Kuszleika, after\r\nreplenishing himself with a pot of beer, returns to his platform, and,\r\nstanding up, reviews the scene; he taps authoritatively upon the side\r\nof his violin, then tucks it carefully under his chin, then waves his\r\nbow in an elaborate flourish, and finally smites the sounding strings\r\nand closes his eyes, and floats away in spirit upon the wings of a\r\ndreamy waltz.",
        "His companion follows, but with his eyes open, watching\r\nwhere he treads, so to speak; and finally Valentinavyczia, after\r\nwaiting for a little and beating with his foot to get the time, casts\r\nup his eyes to the ceiling and begins to saw—“Broom!",
        "broom!",
        "broom!”\r\n\r\nThe company pairs off quickly, and the whole room is soon in motion.",
        "Apparently nobody knows how to waltz, but that is nothing of any\r\nconsequence—there is music, and they dance, each as he pleases, just as\r\nbefore they sang.",
        "Most of them prefer the “two-step,” especially the\r\nyoung, with whom it is the fashion.",
        "The older people have dances from\r\nhome, strange and complicated steps which they execute with grave\r\nsolemnity.",
        "Some do not dance anything at all, but simply hold each\r\nother’s hands and allow the undisciplined joy of motion to express\r\nitself with their feet.",
        "Among these are Jokubas Szedvilas and his wife,\r\nLucija, who together keep the delicatessen store, and consume nearly as\r\nmuch as they sell; they are too fat to dance, but they stand in the\r\nmiddle of the floor, holding each other fast in their arms, rocking\r\nslowly from side to side and grinning seraphically, a picture of\r\ntoothless and perspiring ecstasy.",
        "Of these older people many wear clothing reminiscent in some detail of\r\nhome—an embroidered waistcoat or stomacher, or a gaily colored\r\nhandkerchief, or a coat with large cuffs and fancy buttons.",
        "All these\r\nthings are carefully avoided by the young, most of whom have learned to\r\nspeak English and to affect the latest style of clothing.",
        "The girls\r\nwear ready-made dresses or shirt waists, and some of them look quite\r\npretty.",
        "Some of the young men you would take to be Americans, of the\r\ntype of clerks, but for the fact that they wear their hats in the room.",
        "Each of these younger couples affects a style of its own in dancing.",
        "Some hold each other tightly, some at a cautious distance.",
        "Some hold\r\ntheir hands out stiffly, some drop them loosely at their sides.",
        "Some\r\ndance springily, some glide softly, some move with grave dignity.",
        "There\r\nare boisterous couples, who tear wildly about the room, knocking every\r\none out of their way.",
        "There are nervous couples, whom these frighten,\r\nand who cry, “Nusfok!",
        "Kas yra?” at them as they pass.",
        "Each couple is\r\npaired for the evening—you will never see them change about.",
        "There is\r\nAlena Jasaityte, for instance, who has danced unending hours with\r\nJuozas Raczius, to whom she is engaged.",
        "Alena is the beauty of the\r\nevening, and she would be really beautiful if she were not so proud.",
        "She wears a white shirtwaist, which represents, perhaps, half a week’s\r\nlabor painting cans.",
        "She holds her skirt with her hand as she dances,\r\nwith stately precision, after the manner of the _grandes dames_.",
        "Juozas\r\nis driving one of Durham’s wagons, and is making big wages.",
        "He affects\r\na “tough” aspect, wearing his hat on one side and keeping a cigarette\r\nin his mouth all the evening.",
        "Then there is Jadvyga Marcinkus, who is\r\nalso beautiful, but humble.",
        "Jadvyga likewise paints cans, but then she\r\nhas an invalid mother and three little sisters to support by it, and so\r\nshe does not spend her wages for shirtwaists.",
        "Jadvyga is small and\r\ndelicate, with jet-black eyes and hair, the latter twisted into a\r\nlittle knot and tied on the top of her head.",
        "She wears an old white\r\ndress which she has made herself and worn to parties for the past five\r\nyears; it is high-waisted—almost under her arms, and not very\r\nbecoming,—but that does not trouble Jadvyga, who is dancing with her\r\nMikolas.",
        "She is small, while he is big and powerful; she nestles in his\r\narms as if she would hide herself from view, and leans her head upon\r\nhis shoulder.",
        "He in turn has clasped his arms tightly around her, as if\r\nhe would carry her away; and so she dances, and will dance the entire\r\nevening, and would dance forever, in ecstasy of bliss.",
        "You would smile,\r\nperhaps, to see them—but you would not smile if you knew all the story.",
        "This is the fifth year, now, that Jadvyga has been engaged to Mikolas,\r\nand her heart is sick.",
        "They would have been married in the beginning,\r\nonly Mikolas has a father who is drunk all day, and he is the only\r\nother man in a large family.",
        "Even so they might have managed it (for\r\nMikolas is a skilled man) but for cruel accidents which have almost\r\ntaken the heart out of them.",
        "He is a beef-boner, and that is a\r\ndangerous trade, especially when you are on piecework and trying to\r\nearn a bride.",
        "Your hands are slippery, and your knife is slippery, and\r\nyou are toiling like mad, when somebody happens to speak to you, or you\r\nstrike a bone.",
        "Then your hand slips up on the blade, and there is a\r\nfearful gash.",
        "And that would not be so bad, only for the deadly\r\ncontagion.",
        "The cut may heal, but you never can tell.",
        "Twice now; within\r\nthe last three years, Mikolas has been lying at home with blood\r\npoisoning—once for three months and once for nearly seven.",
        "The last\r\ntime, too, he lost his job, and that meant six weeks more of standing\r\nat the doors of the packing houses, at six o’clock on bitter winter\r\nmornings, with a foot of snow on the ground and more in the air.",
        "There\r\nare learned people who can tell you out of the statistics that\r\nbeef-boners make forty cents an hour, but, perhaps, these people have\r\nnever looked into a beef-boner’s hands.",
        "When Tamoszius and his companions stop for a rest, as perforce they\r\nmust, now and then, the dancers halt where they are and wait patiently.",
        "They never seem to tire; and there is no place for them to sit down if\r\nthey did.",
        "It is only for a minute, anyway, for the leader starts up\r\nagain, in spite of all the protests of the other two.",
        "This time it is\r\nanother sort of a dance, a Lithuanian dance.",
        "Those who prefer to, go on\r\nwith the two-step, but the majority go through an intricate series of\r\nmotions, resembling more fancy skating than a dance.",
        "The climax of it\r\nis a furious _prestissimo_, at which the couples seize hands and begin\r\na mad whirling.",
        "This is quite irresistible, and every one in the room\r\njoins in, until the place becomes a maze of flying skirts and bodies\r\nquite dazzling to look upon.",
        "But the sight of sights at this moment is\r\nTamoszius Kuszleika.",
        "The old fiddle squeaks and shrieks in protest, but\r\nTamoszius has no mercy.",
        "The sweat starts out on his forehead, and he\r\nbends over like a cyclist on the last lap of a race.",
        "His body shakes\r\nand throbs like a runaway steam engine, and the ear cannot follow the\r\nflying showers of notes—there is a pale blue mist where you look to see\r\nhis bowing arm.",
        "With a most wonderful rush he comes to the end of the\r\ntune, and flings up his hands and staggers back exhausted; and with a\r\nfinal shout of delight the dancers fly apart, reeling here and there,\r\nbringing up against the walls of the room.",
        "After this there is beer for every one, the musicians included, and the\r\nrevelers take a long breath and prepare for the great event of the\r\nevening, which is the _acziavimas_.",
        "The _acziavimas_ is a ceremony\r\nwhich, once begun, will continue for three or four hours, and it\r\ninvolves one uninterrupted dance.",
        "The guests form a great ring, locking\r\nhands, and, when the music starts up, begin to move around in a circle.",
        "In the center stands the bride, and, one by one, the men step into the\r\nenclosure and dance with her.",
        "Each dances for several minutes—as long\r\nas he pleases; it is a very merry proceeding, with laughter and\r\nsinging, and when the guest has finished, he finds himself face to face\r\nwith Teta Elzbieta, who holds the hat.",
        "Into it he drops a sum of\r\nmoney—a dollar, or perhaps five dollars, according to his power, and\r\nhis estimate of the value of the privilege.",
        "The guests are expected to\r\npay for this entertainment; if they be proper guests, they will see\r\nthat there is a neat sum left over for the bride and bridegroom to\r\nstart life upon.",
        "Most fearful they are to contemplate, the expenses of this\r\nentertainment.",
        "They will certainly be over two hundred dollars and\r\nmaybe three hundred; and three hundred dollars is more than the year’s\r\nincome of many a person in this room.",
        "There are able-bodied men here\r\nwho work from early morning until late at night, in ice-cold cellars\r\nwith a quarter of an inch of water on the floor—men who for six or\r\nseven months in the year never see the sunlight from Sunday afternoon\r\ntill the next Sunday morning—and who cannot earn three hundred dollars\r\nin a year.",
        "There are little children here, scarce in their teens, who\r\ncan hardly see the top of the work benches—whose parents have lied to\r\nget them their places—and who do not make the half of three hundred\r\ndollars a year, and perhaps not even the third of it.",
        "And then to spend\r\nsuch a sum, all in a single day of your life, at a wedding feast!",
        "(For\r\nobviously it is the same thing, whether you spend it at once for your\r\nown wedding, or in a long time, at the weddings of all your friends.)\r\n\r\nIt is very imprudent, it is tragic—but, ah, it is so beautiful!",
        "Bit by\r\nbit these poor people have given up everything else; but to this they\r\ncling with all the power of their souls—they cannot give up the\r\n_veselija!_ To do that would mean, not merely to be defeated, but to\r\nacknowledge defeat—and the difference between these two things is what\r\nkeeps the world going.",
        "The _veselija_ has come down to them from a\r\nfar-off time; and the meaning of it was that one might dwell within the\r\ncave and gaze upon shadows, provided only that once in his lifetime he\r\ncould break his chains, and feel his wings, and behold the sun;\r\nprovided that once in his lifetime he might testify to the fact that\r\nlife, with all its cares and its terrors, is no such great thing after\r\nall, but merely a bubble upon the surface of a river, a thing that one\r\nmay toss about and play with as a juggler tosses his golden balls, a\r\nthing that one may quaff, like a goblet of rare red wine.",
        "Thus having\r\nknown himself for the master of things, a man could go back to his toil\r\nand live upon the memory all his days.",
        "Endlessly the dancers swung round and round—when they were dizzy they\r\nswung the other way.",
        "Hour after hour this had continued—the darkness\r\nhad fallen and the room was dim from the light of two smoky oil lamps.",
        "The musicians had spent all their fine frenzy by now, and played only\r\none tune, wearily, ploddingly.",
        "There were twenty bars or so of it, and\r\nwhen they came to the end they began again.",
        "Once every ten minutes or\r\nso they would fail to begin again, but instead would sink back\r\nexhausted; a circumstance which invariably brought on a painful and\r\nterrifying scene, that made the fat policeman stir uneasily in his\r\nsleeping place behind the door.",
        "It was all Marija Berczynskas.",
        "Marija was one of those hungry souls who\r\ncling with desperation to the skirts of the retreating muse.",
        "All day\r\nlong she had been in a state of wonderful exaltation; and now it was\r\nleaving—and she would not let it go.",
        "Her soul cried out in the words of\r\nFaust, “Stay, thou art fair!” Whether it was by beer, or by shouting,\r\nor by music, or by motion, she meant that it should not go.",
        "And she\r\nwould go back to the chase of it—and no sooner be fairly started than\r\nher chariot would be thrown off the track, so to speak, by the\r\nstupidity of those thrice accursed musicians.",
        "Each time, Marija would\r\nemit a howl and fly at them, shaking her fists in their faces, stamping\r\nupon the floor, purple and incoherent with rage.",
        "In vain the frightened\r\nTamoszius would attempt to speak, to plead the limitations of the\r\nflesh; in vain would the puffing and breathless ponas Jokubas insist,\r\nin vain would Teta Elzbieta implore.",
        "“Szalin!” Marija would scream.",
        "“Palauk!",
        "isz kelio!",
        "What are you paid for, children of hell?” And so,\r\nin sheer terror, the orchestra would strike up again, and Marija would\r\nreturn to her place and take up her task.",
        "She bore all the burden of the festivities now.",
        "Ona was kept up by her\r\nexcitement, but all of the women and most of the men were tired—the\r\nsoul of Marija was alone unconquered.",
        "She drove on the dancers—what had\r\nonce been the ring had now the shape of a pear, with Marija at the\r\nstem, pulling one way and pushing the other, shouting, stamping,\r\nsinging, a very volcano of energy.",
        "Now and then some one coming in or\r\nout would leave the door open, and the night air was chill; Marija as\r\nshe passed would stretch out her foot and kick the doorknob, and slam\r\nwould go the door!",
        "Once this procedure was the cause of a calamity of\r\nwhich Sebastijonas Szedvilas was the hapless victim.",
        "Little\r\nSebastijonas, aged three, had been wandering about oblivious to all\r\nthings, holding turned up over his mouth a bottle of liquid known as\r\n“pop,” pink-colored, ice-cold, and delicious.",
        "Passing through the\r\ndoorway the door smote him full, and the shriek which followed brought\r\nthe dancing to a halt.",
        "Marija, who threatened horrid murder a hundred\r\ntimes a day, and would weep over the injury of a fly, seized little\r\nSebastijonas in her arms and bid fair to smother him with kisses.",
        "There\r\nwas a long rest for the orchestra, and plenty of refreshments, while\r\nMarija was making her peace with her victim, seating him upon the bar,\r\nand standing beside him and holding to his lips a foaming schooner of\r\nbeer.",
        "In the meantime there was going on in another corner of the room an\r\nanxious conference between Teta Elzbieta and Dede Antanas, and a few of\r\nthe more intimate friends of the family.",
        "A trouble was come upon them.",
        "The _veselija_ is a compact, a compact not expressed, but therefore\r\nonly the more binding upon all.",
        "Every one’s share was different—and yet\r\nevery one knew perfectly well what his share was, and strove to give a\r\nlittle more.",
        "Now, however, since they had come to the new country, all\r\nthis was changing; it seemed as if there must be some subtle poison in\r\nthe air that one breathed here—it was affecting all the young men at\r\nonce.",
        "They would come in crowds and fill themselves with a fine dinner,\r\nand then sneak off.",
        "One would throw another’s hat out of the window,\r\nand both would go out to get it, and neither could be seen again.",
        "Or\r\nnow and then half a dozen of them would get together and march out\r\nopenly, staring at you, and making fun of you to your face.",
        "Still\r\nothers, worse yet, would crowd about the bar, and at the expense of the\r\nhost drink themselves sodden, paying not the least attention to any\r\none, and leaving it to be thought that either they had danced with the\r\nbride already, or meant to later on.",
        "All these things were going on now, and the family was helpless with\r\ndismay.",
        "So long they had toiled, and such an outlay they had made!",
        "Ona\r\nstood by, her eyes wide with terror.",
        "Those frightful bills—how they had\r\nhaunted her, each item gnawing at her soul all day and spoiling her\r\nrest at night.",
        "How often she had named them over one by one and figured\r\non them as she went to work—fifteen dollars for the hall, twenty-two\r\ndollars and a quarter for the ducks, twelve dollars for the musicians,\r\nfive dollars at the church, and a blessing of the Virgin besides—and so\r\non without an end!",
        "Worst of all was the frightful bill that was still\r\nto come from Graiczunas for the beer and liquor that might be consumed.",
        "One could never get in advance more than a guess as to this from a\r\nsaloon-keeper—and then, when the time came he always came to you\r\nscratching his head and saying that he had guessed too low, but that he\r\nhad done his best—your guests had gotten so very drunk.",
        "By him you were\r\nsure to be cheated unmercifully, and that even though you thought\r\nyourself the dearest of the hundreds of friends he had.",
        "He would begin\r\nto serve your guests out of a keg that was half full, and finish with\r\none that was half empty, and then you would be charged for two kegs of\r\nbeer.",
        "He would agree to serve a certain quality at a certain price, and\r\nwhen the time came you and your friends would be drinking some horrible\r\npoison that could not be described.",
        "You might complain, but you would\r\nget nothing for your pains but a ruined evening; while, as for going to\r\nlaw about it, you might as well go to heaven at once.",
        "The saloon-keeper\r\nstood in with all the big politics men in the district; and when you\r\nhad once found out what it meant to get into trouble with such people,\r\nyou would know enough to pay what you were told to pay and shut up.",
        "What made all this the more painful was that it was so hard on the few\r\nthat had really done their best.",
        "There was poor old ponas Jokubas, for\r\ninstance—he had already given five dollars, and did not every one know\r\nthat Jokubas Szedvilas had just mortgaged his delicatessen store for\r\ntwo hundred dollars to meet several months’ overdue rent?",
        "And then\r\nthere was withered old poni Aniele—who was a widow, and had three\r\nchildren, and the rheumatism besides, and did washing for the\r\ntradespeople on Halsted Street at prices it would break your heart to\r\nhear named.",
        "Aniele had given the entire profit of her chickens for\r\nseveral months.",
        "Eight of them she owned, and she kept them in a little\r\nplace fenced around on her backstairs.",
        "All day long the children of\r\nAniele were raking in the dump for food for these chickens; and\r\nsometimes, when the competition there was too fierce, you might see\r\nthem on Halsted Street walking close to the gutters, and with their\r\nmother following to see that no one robbed them of their finds.",
        "Money\r\ncould not tell the value of these chickens to old Mrs.",
        "Jukniene—she\r\nvalued them differently, for she had a feeling that she was getting\r\nsomething for nothing by means of them—that with them she was getting\r\nthe better of a world that was getting the better of her in so many\r\nother ways.",
        "So she watched them every hour of the day, and had learned\r\nto see like an owl at night to watch them then.",
        "One of them had been\r\nstolen long ago, and not a month passed that some one did not try to\r\nsteal another.",
        "As the frustrating of this one attempt involved a score\r\nof false alarms, it will be understood what a tribute old Mrs.",
        "Jukniene\r\nbrought, just because Teta Elzbieta had once loaned her some money for\r\na few days and saved her from being turned out of her house.",
        "More and more friends gathered round while the lamentation about these\r\nthings was going on.",
        "Some drew nearer, hoping to overhear the\r\nconversation, who were themselves among the guilty—and surely that was\r\na thing to try the patience of a saint.",
        "Finally there came Jurgis,\r\nurged by some one, and the story was retold to him.",
        "Jurgis listened in\r\nsilence, with his great black eyebrows knitted.",
        "Now and then there\r\nwould come a gleam underneath them and he would glance about the room.",
        "Perhaps he would have liked to go at some of those fellows with his big\r\nclenched fists; but then, doubtless, he realized how little good it\r\nwould do him.",
        "No bill would be any less for turning out any one at this\r\ntime; and then there would be the scandal—and Jurgis wanted nothing\r\nexcept to get away with Ona and to let the world go its own way.",
        "So his\r\nhands relaxed and he merely said quietly: “It is done, and there is no\r\nuse in weeping, Teta Elzbieta.” Then his look turned toward Ona, who\r\nstood close to his side, and he saw the wide look of terror in her\r\neyes.",
        "“Little one,” he said, in a low voice, “do not worry—it will not\r\nmatter to us.",
        "We will pay them all somehow.",
        "I will work harder.” That\r\nwas always what Jurgis said.",
        "Ona had grown used to it as the solution\r\nof all difficulties—“I will work harder!” He had said that in Lithuania\r\nwhen one official had taken his passport from him, and another had\r\narrested him for being without it, and the two had divided a third of\r\nhis belongings.",
        "He had said it again in New York, when the\r\nsmooth-spoken agent had taken them in hand and made them pay such high\r\nprices, and almost prevented their leaving his place, in spite of their\r\npaying.",
        "Now he said it a third time, and Ona drew a deep breath; it was\r\nso wonderful to have a husband, just like a grown woman—and a husband\r\nwho could solve all problems, and who was so big and strong!",
        "The last sob of little Sebastijonas has been stifled, and the orchestra\r\nhas once more been reminded of its duty.",
        "The ceremony begins again—but\r\nthere are few now left to dance with, and so very soon the collection\r\nis over and promiscuous dances once more begin.",
        "It is now after\r\nmidnight, however, and things are not as they were before.",
        "The dancers\r\nare dull and heavy—most of them have been drinking hard, and have long\r\nago passed the stage of exhilaration.",
        "They dance in monotonous measure,\r\nround after round, hour after hour, with eyes fixed upon vacancy, as if\r\nthey were only half conscious, in a constantly growing stupor.",
        "The men\r\ngrasp the women very tightly, but there will be half an hour together\r\nwhen neither will see the other’s face.",
        "Some couples do not care to\r\ndance, and have retired to the corners, where they sit with their arms\r\nenlaced.",
        "Others, who have been drinking still more, wander about the\r\nroom, bumping into everything; some are in groups of two or three,\r\nsinging, each group its own song.",
        "As time goes on there is a variety of\r\ndrunkenness, among the younger men especially.",
        "Some stagger about in\r\neach other’s arms, whispering maudlin words—others start quarrels upon\r\nthe slightest pretext, and come to blows and have to be pulled apart.",
        "Now the fat policeman wakens definitely, and feels of his club to see\r\nthat it is ready for business.",
        "He has to be prompt—for these\r\ntwo-o’clock-in-the-morning fights, if they once get out of hand, are\r\nlike a forest fire, and may mean the whole reserves at the station.",
        "The\r\nthing to do is to crack every fighting head that you see, before there\r\nare so many fighting heads that you cannot crack any of them.",
        "There is\r\nbut scant account kept of cracked heads in back of the yards, for men\r\nwho have to crack the heads of animals all day seem to get into the\r\nhabit, and to practice on their friends, and even on their families,\r\nbetween times.",
        "This makes it a cause for congratulation that by modern\r\nmethods a very few men can do the painfully necessary work of\r\nhead-cracking for the whole of the cultured world.",
        "There is no fight that night—perhaps because Jurgis, too, is\r\nwatchful—even more so than the policeman.",
        "Jurgis has drunk a great\r\ndeal, as any one naturally would on an occasion when it all has to be\r\npaid for, whether it is drunk or not; but he is a very steady man, and\r\ndoes not easily lose his temper.",
        "Only once there is a tight shave—and\r\nthat is the fault of Marija Berczynskas.",
        "Marija has apparently\r\nconcluded about two hours ago that if the altar in the corner, with the\r\ndeity in soiled white, be not the true home of the muses, it is, at any\r\nrate, the nearest substitute on earth attainable.",
        "And Marija is just\r\nfighting drunk when there come to her ears the facts about the villains\r\nwho have not paid that night.",
        "Marija goes on the warpath straight off,\r\nwithout even the preliminary of a good cursing, and when she is pulled\r\noff it is with the coat collars of two villains in her hands.",
        "Fortunately, the policeman is disposed to be reasonable, and so it is\r\nnot Marija who is flung out of the place.",
        "All this interrupts the music for not more than a minute or two.",
        "Then\r\nagain the merciless tune begins—the tune that has been played for the\r\nlast half-hour without one single change.",
        "It is an American tune this\r\ntime, one which they have picked up on the streets; all seem to know\r\nthe words of it—or, at any rate, the first line of it, which they hum\r\nto themselves, over and over again without rest: “In the good old\r\nsummertime—in the good old summertime!",
        "In the good old summertime—in\r\nthe good old summertime!” There seems to be something hypnotic about\r\nthis, with its endlessly recurring dominant.",
        "It has put a stupor upon\r\nevery one who hears it, as well as upon the men who are playing it.",
        "No\r\none can get away from it, or even think of getting away from it; it is\r\nthree o’clock in the morning, and they have danced out all their joy,\r\nand danced out all their strength, and all the strength that unlimited\r\ndrink can lend them—and still there is no one among them who has the\r\npower to think of stopping.",
        "Promptly at seven o’clock this same Monday\r\nmorning they will every one of them have to be in their places at\r\nDurham’s or Brown’s or Jones’s, each in his working clothes.",
        "If one of\r\nthem be a minute late, he will be docked an hour’s pay, and if he be\r\nmany minutes late, he will be apt to find his brass check turned to the\r\nwall, which will send him out to join the hungry mob that waits every\r\nmorning at the gates of the packing houses, from six o’clock until\r\nnearly half-past eight.",
        "There is no exception to this rule, not even\r\nlittle Ona—who has asked for a holiday the day after her wedding day, a\r\nholiday without pay, and been refused.",
        "While there are so many who are\r\nanxious to work as you wish, there is no occasion for incommoding\r\nyourself with those who must work otherwise.",
        "Little Ona is nearly ready to faint—and half in a stupor herself,\r\nbecause of the heavy scent in the room.",
        "She has not taken a drop, but\r\nevery one else there is literally burning alcohol, as the lamps are\r\nburning oil; some of the men who are sound asleep in their chairs or on\r\nthe floor are reeking of it so that you cannot go near them.",
        "Now and\r\nthen Jurgis gazes at her hungrily—he has long since forgotten his\r\nshyness; but then the crowd is there, and he still waits and watches\r\nthe door, where a carriage is supposed to come.",
        "It does not, and\r\nfinally he will wait no longer, but comes up to Ona, who turns white\r\nand trembles.",
        "He puts her shawl about her and then his own coat.",
        "They\r\nlive only two blocks away, and Jurgis does not care about the carriage.",
        "There is almost no farewell—the dancers do not notice them, and all of\r\nthe children and many of the old folks have fallen asleep of sheer\r\nexhaustion.",
        "Dede Antanas is asleep, and so are the Szedvilases, husband\r\nand wife, the former snoring in octaves.",
        "There is Teta Elzbieta, and\r\nMarija, sobbing loudly; and then there is only the silent night, with\r\nthe stars beginning to pale a little in the east.",
        "Jurgis, without a\r\nword, lifts Ona in his arms, and strides out with her, and she sinks\r\nher head upon his shoulder with a moan.",
        "When he reaches home he is not\r\nsure whether she has fainted or is asleep, but when he has to hold her\r\nwith one hand while he unlocks the door, he sees that she has opened\r\nher eyes.",
        "“You shall not go to Brown’s today, little one,” he whispers, as he\r\nclimbs the stairs; and she catches his arm in terror, gasping: “No!",
        "No!",
        "I dare not!",
        "It will ruin us!”\r\n\r\nBut he answers her again: “Leave it to me; leave it to me.",
        "I will earn\r\nmore money—I will work harder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis talked lightly about work, because he was young.",
        "They told him\r\nstories about the breaking down of men, there in the stockyards of\r\nChicago, and of what had happened to them afterward—stories to make\r\nyour flesh creep, but Jurgis would only laugh.",
        "He had only been there\r\nfour months, and he was young, and a giant besides.",
        "There was too much\r\nhealth in him.",
        "He could not even imagine how it would feel to be\r\nbeaten.",
        "“That is well enough for men like you,” he would say,\r\n“_silpnas_, puny fellows—but my back is broad.”\r\n\r\nJurgis was like a boy, a boy from the country.",
        "He was the sort of man\r\nthe bosses like to get hold of, the sort they make it a grievance they\r\ncannot get hold of.",
        "When he was told to go to a certain place, he would\r\ngo there on the run.",
        "When he had nothing to do for the moment, he would\r\nstand round fidgeting, dancing, with the overflow of energy that was in\r\nhim.",
        "If he were working in a line of men, the line always moved too\r\nslowly for him, and you could pick him out by his impatience and\r\nrestlessness.",
        "That was why he had been picked out on one important\r\noccasion; for Jurgis had stood outside of Brown and Company’s “Central\r\nTime Station” not more than half an hour, the second day of his arrival\r\nin Chicago, before he had been beckoned by one of the bosses.",
        "Of this\r\nhe was very proud, and it made him more disposed than ever to laugh at\r\nthe pessimists.",
        "In vain would they all tell him that there were men in\r\nthat crowd from which he had been chosen who had stood there a\r\nmonth—yes, many months—and not been chosen yet.",
        "“Yes,” he would say,\r\n“but what sort of men?",
        "Broken-down tramps and good-for-nothings,\r\nfellows who have spent all their money drinking, and want to get more\r\nfor it.",
        "Do you want me to believe that with these arms”—and he would\r\nclench his fists and hold them up in the air, so that you might see the\r\nrolling muscles—“that with these arms people will ever let me starve?”\r\n\r\n“It is plain,” they would answer to this, “that you have come from the\r\ncountry, and from very far in the country.” And this was the fact, for\r\nJurgis had never seen a city, and scarcely even a fair-sized town,\r\nuntil he had set out to make his fortune in the world and earn his\r\nright to Ona.",
        "His father, and his father’s father before him, and as\r\nmany ancestors back as legend could go, had lived in that part of\r\nLithuania known as _Brelovicz_, the Imperial Forest.",
        "This is a great\r\ntract of a hundred thousand acres, which from time immemorial has been\r\na hunting preserve of the nobility.",
        "There are a very few peasants\r\nsettled in it, holding title from ancient times; and one of these was\r\nAntanas Rudkus, who had been reared himself, and had reared his\r\nchildren in turn, upon half a dozen acres of cleared land in the midst\r\nof a wilderness.",
        "There had been one son besides Jurgis, and one sister.",
        "The former had been drafted into the army; that had been over ten years\r\nago, but since that day nothing had ever been heard of him.",
        "The sister\r\nwas married, and her husband had bought the place when old Antanas had\r\ndecided to go with his son.",
        "It was nearly a year and a half ago that Jurgis had met Ona, at a horse\r\nfair a hundred miles from home.",
        "Jurgis had never expected to get\r\nmarried—he had laughed at it as a foolish trap for a man to walk into;\r\nbut here, without ever having spoken a word to her, with no more than\r\nthe exchange of half a dozen smiles, he found himself, purple in the\r\nface with embarrassment and terror, asking her parents to sell her to\r\nhim for his wife—and offering his father’s two horses he had been sent\r\nto the fair to sell.",
        "But Ona’s father proved as a rock—the girl was yet\r\na child, and he was a rich man, and his daughter was not to be had in\r\nthat way.",
        "So Jurgis went home with a heavy heart, and that spring and\r\nsummer toiled and tried hard to forget.",
        "In the fall, after the harvest\r\nwas over, he saw that it would not do, and tramped the full fortnight’s\r\njourney that lay between him and Ona.",
        "He found an unexpected state of affairs—for the girl’s father had died,\r\nand his estate was tied up with creditors; Jurgis’ heart leaped as he\r\nrealized that now the prize was within his reach.",
        "There was Elzbieta\r\nLukoszaite, Teta, or Aunt, as they called her, Ona’s stepmother, and\r\nthere were her six children, of all ages.",
        "There was also her brother\r\nJonas, a dried-up little man who had worked upon the farm.",
        "They were\r\npeople of great consequence, as it seemed to Jurgis, fresh out of the\r\nwoods; Ona knew how to read, and knew many other things that he did not\r\nknow, and now the farm had been sold, and the whole family was\r\nadrift—all they owned in the world being about seven hundred rubles\r\nwhich is half as many dollars.",
        "They would have had three times that,\r\nbut it had gone to court, and the judge had decided against them, and\r\nit had cost the balance to get him to change his decision.",
        "Ona might have married and left them, but she would not, for she loved\r\nTeta Elzbieta.",
        "It was Jonas who suggested that they all go to America,\r\nwhere a friend of his had gotten rich.",
        "He would work, for his part, and\r\nthe women would work, and some of the children, doubtless—they would\r\nlive somehow.",
        "Jurgis, too, had heard of America.",
        "That was a country\r\nwhere, they said, a man might earn three rubles a day; and Jurgis\r\nfigured what three rubles a day would mean, with prices as they were\r\nwhere he lived, and decided forthwith that he would go to America and\r\nmarry, and be a rich man in the bargain.",
        "In that country, rich or poor,\r\na man was free, it was said; he did not have to go into the army, he\r\ndid not have to pay out his money to rascally officials—he might do as\r\nhe pleased, and count himself as good as any other man.",
        "So America was\r\na place of which lovers and young people dreamed.",
        "If one could only\r\nmanage to get the price of a passage, he could count his troubles at an\r\nend.",
        "It was arranged that they should leave the following spring, and\r\nmeantime Jurgis sold himself to a contractor for a certain time, and\r\ntramped nearly four hundred miles from home with a gang of men to work\r\nupon a railroad in Smolensk.",
        "This was a fearful experience, with filth\r\nand bad food and cruelty and overwork; but Jurgis stood it and came out\r\nin fine trim, and with eighty rubles sewed up in his coat.",
        "He did not\r\ndrink or fight, because he was thinking all the time of Ona; and for\r\nthe rest, he was a quiet, steady man, who did what he was told to, did\r\nnot lose his temper often, and when he did lose it made the offender\r\nanxious that he should not lose it again.",
        "When they paid him off he\r\ndodged the company gamblers and dramshops, and so they tried to kill\r\nhim; but he escaped, and tramped it home, working at odd jobs, and\r\nsleeping always with one eye open.",
        "So in the summer time they had all set out for America.",
        "At the last\r\nmoment there joined them Marija Berczynskas, who was a cousin of Ona’s.",
        "Marija was an orphan, and had worked since childhood for a rich farmer\r\nof Vilna, who beat her regularly.",
        "It was only at the age of twenty that\r\nit had occurred to Marija to try her strength, when she had risen up\r\nand nearly murdered the man, and then come away.",
        "There were twelve in all in the party, five adults and six children—and\r\nOna, who was a little of both.",
        "They had a hard time on the passage;\r\nthere was an agent who helped them, but he proved a scoundrel, and got\r\nthem into a trap with some officials, and cost them a good deal of\r\ntheir precious money, which they clung to with such horrible fear.",
        "This\r\nhappened to them again in New York—for, of course, they knew nothing\r\nabout the country, and had no one to tell them, and it was easy for a\r\nman in a blue uniform to lead them away, and to take them to a hotel\r\nand keep them there, and make them pay enormous charges to get away.",
        "The law says that the rate card shall be on the door of a hotel, but it\r\ndoes not say that it shall be in Lithuanian.",
        "It was in the stockyards that Jonas’ friend had gotten rich, and so to\r\nChicago the party was bound.",
        "They knew that one word, Chicago and that\r\nwas all they needed to know, at least, until they reached the city.",
        "Then, tumbled out of the cars without ceremony, they were no better off\r\nthan before; they stood staring down the vista of Dearborn Street, with\r\nits big black buildings towering in the distance, unable to realize\r\nthat they had arrived, and why, when they said “Chicago,” people no\r\nlonger pointed in some direction, but instead looked perplexed, or\r\nlaughed, or went on without paying any attention.",
        "They were pitiable in\r\ntheir helplessness; above all things they stood in deadly terror of any\r\nsort of person in official uniform, and so whenever they saw a\r\npoliceman they would cross the street and hurry by.",
        "For the whole of\r\nthe first day they wandered about in the midst of deafening confusion,\r\nutterly lost; and it was only at night that, cowering in the doorway of\r\na house, they were finally discovered and taken by a policeman to the\r\nstation.",
        "In the morning an interpreter was found, and they were taken\r\nand put upon a car, and taught a new word—“stockyards.” Their delight\r\nat discovering that they were to get out of this adventure without\r\nlosing another share of their possessions it would not be possible to\r\ndescribe.",
        "They sat and stared out of the window.",
        "They were on a street which\r\nseemed to run on forever, mile after mile—thirty-four of them, if they\r\nhad known it—and each side of it one uninterrupted row of wretched\r\nlittle two-story frame buildings.",
        "Down every side street they could\r\nsee, it was the same—never a hill and never a hollow, but always the\r\nsame endless vista of ugly and dirty little wooden buildings.",
        "Here and\r\nthere would be a bridge crossing a filthy creek, with hard-baked mud\r\nshores and dingy sheds and docks along it; here and there would be a\r\nrailroad crossing, with a tangle of switches, and locomotives puffing,\r\nand rattling freight cars filing by; here and there would be a great\r\nfactory, a dingy building with innumerable windows in it, and immense\r\nvolumes of smoke pouring from the chimneys, darkening the air above and\r\nmaking filthy the earth beneath.",
        "But after each of these interruptions,\r\nthe desolate procession would begin again—the procession of dreary\r\nlittle buildings.",
        "A full hour before the party reached the city they had begun to note\r\nthe perplexing changes in the atmosphere.",
        "It grew darker all the time,\r\nand upon the earth the grass seemed to grow less green.",
        "Every minute,\r\nas the train sped on, the colors of things became dingier; the fields\r\nwere grown parched and yellow, the landscape hideous and bare.",
        "And\r\nalong with the thickening smoke they began to notice another\r\ncircumstance, a strange, pungent odor.",
        "They were not sure that it was\r\nunpleasant, this odor; some might have called it sickening, but their\r\ntaste in odors was not developed, and they were only sure that it was\r\ncurious.",
        "Now, sitting in the trolley car, they realized that they were\r\non their way to the home of it—that they had traveled all the way from\r\nLithuania to it.",
        "It was now no longer something far off and faint, that\r\nyou caught in whiffs; you could literally taste it, as well as smell\r\nit—you could take hold of it, almost, and examine it at your leisure.",
        "They were divided in their opinions about it.",
        "It was an elemental odor,\r\nraw and crude; it was rich, almost rancid, sensual, and strong.",
        "There\r\nwere some who drank it in as if it were an intoxicant; there were\r\nothers who put their handkerchiefs to their faces.",
        "The new emigrants\r\nwere still tasting it, lost in wonder, when suddenly the car came to a\r\nhalt, and the door was flung open, and a voice shouted—“Stockyards!”\r\n\r\nThey were left standing upon the corner, staring; down a side street\r\nthere were two rows of brick houses, and between them a vista: half a\r\ndozen chimneys, tall as the tallest of buildings, touching the very\r\nsky—and leaping from them half a dozen columns of smoke, thick, oily,\r\nand black as night.",
        "It might have come from the center of the world,\r\nthis smoke, where the fires of the ages still smolder.",
        "It came as if\r\nself-impelled, driving all before it, a perpetual explosion.",
        "It was\r\ninexhaustible; one stared, waiting to see it stop, but still the great\r\nstreams rolled out.",
        "They spread in vast clouds overhead, writhing,\r\ncurling; then, uniting in one giant river, they streamed away down the\r\nsky, stretching a black pall as far as the eye could reach.",
        "Then the party became aware of another strange thing.",
        "This, too, like\r\nthe color, was a thing elemental; it was a sound, a sound made up of\r\nten thousand little sounds.",
        "You scarcely noticed it at first—it sunk\r\ninto your consciousness, a vague disturbance, a trouble.",
        "It was like\r\nthe murmuring of the bees in the spring, the whisperings of the forest;\r\nit suggested endless activity, the rumblings of a world in motion.",
        "It\r\nwas only by an effort that one could realize that it was made by\r\nanimals, that it was the distant lowing of ten thousand cattle, the\r\ndistant grunting of ten thousand swine.",
        "They would have liked to follow it up, but, alas, they had no time for\r\nadventures just then.",
        "The policeman on the corner was beginning to\r\nwatch them; and so, as usual, they started up the street.",
        "Scarcely had\r\nthey gone a block, however, before Jonas was heard to give a cry, and\r\nbegan pointing excitedly across the street.",
        "Before they could gather\r\nthe meaning of his breathless ejaculations he had bounded away, and\r\nthey saw him enter a shop, over which was a sign: “J.",
        "Szedvilas,\r\nDelicatessen.” When he came out again it was in company with a very\r\nstout gentleman in shirt sleeves and an apron, clasping Jonas by both\r\nhands and laughing hilariously.",
        "Then Teta Elzbieta recollected suddenly\r\nthat Szedvilas had been the name of the mythical friend who had made\r\nhis fortune in America.",
        "To find that he had been making it in the\r\ndelicatessen business was an extraordinary piece of good fortune at\r\nthis juncture; though it was well on in the morning, they had not\r\nbreakfasted, and the children were beginning to whimper.",
        "Thus was the happy ending to a woeful voyage.",
        "The two families\r\nliterally fell upon each other’s necks—for it had been years since\r\nJokubas Szedvilas had met a man from his part of Lithuania.",
        "Before half\r\nthe day they were lifelong friends.",
        "Jokubas understood all the pitfalls\r\nof this new world, and could explain all of its mysteries; he could\r\ntell them the things they ought to have done in the different\r\nemergencies—and what was still more to the point, he could tell them\r\nwhat to do now.",
        "He would take them to poni Aniele, who kept a\r\nboardinghouse the other side of the yards; old Mrs.",
        "Jukniene, he\r\nexplained, had not what one would call choice accommodations, but they\r\nmight do for the moment.",
        "To this Teta Elzbieta hastened to respond that\r\nnothing could be too cheap to suit them just then; for they were quite\r\nterrified over the sums they had had to expend.",
        "A very few days of\r\npractical experience in this land of high wages had been sufficient to\r\nmake clear to them the cruel fact that it was also a land of high\r\nprices, and that in it the poor man was almost as poor as in any other\r\ncorner of the earth; and so there vanished in a night all the wonderful\r\ndreams of wealth that had been haunting Jurgis.",
        "What had made the\r\ndiscovery all the more painful was that they were spending, at American\r\nprices, money which they had earned at home rates of wages—and so were\r\nreally being cheated by the world!",
        "The last two days they had all but\r\nstarved themselves—it made them quite sick to pay the prices that the\r\nrailroad people asked them for food.",
        "Yet, when they saw the home of the Widow Jukniene they could not but\r\nrecoil, even so, in all their journey they had seen nothing so bad as\r\nthis.",
        "Poni Aniele had a four-room flat in one of that wilderness of\r\ntwo-story frame tenements that lie “back of the yards.” There were four\r\nsuch flats in each building, and each of the four was a “boardinghouse”\r\nfor the occupancy of foreigners—Lithuanians, Poles, Slovaks, or\r\nBohemians.",
        "Some of these places were kept by private persons, some were\r\ncooperative.",
        "There would be an average of half a dozen boarders to each\r\nroom—sometimes there were thirteen or fourteen to one room, fifty or\r\nsixty to a flat.",
        "Each one of the occupants furnished his own\r\naccommodations—that is, a mattress and some bedding.",
        "The mattresses\r\nwould be spread upon the floor in rows—and there would be nothing else\r\nin the place except a stove.",
        "It was by no means unusual for two men to\r\nown the same mattress in common, one working by day and using it by\r\nnight, and the other working at night and using it in the daytime.",
        "Very\r\nfrequently a lodging house keeper would rent the same beds to double\r\nshifts of men.",
        "Mrs.",
        "Jukniene was a wizened-up little woman, with a wrinkled face.",
        "Her\r\nhome was unthinkably filthy; you could not enter by the front door at\r\nall, owing to the mattresses, and when you tried to go up the\r\nbackstairs you found that she had walled up most of the porch with old\r\nboards to make a place to keep her chickens.",
        "It was a standing jest of\r\nthe boarders that Aniele cleaned house by letting the chickens loose in\r\nthe rooms.",
        "Undoubtedly this did keep down the vermin, but it seemed\r\nprobable, in view of all the circumstances, that the old lady regarded\r\nit rather as feeding the chickens than as cleaning the rooms.",
        "The truth\r\nwas that she had definitely given up the idea of cleaning anything,\r\nunder pressure of an attack of rheumatism, which had kept her doubled\r\nup in one corner of her room for over a week; during which time eleven\r\nof her boarders, heavily in her debt, had concluded to try their\r\nchances of employment in Kansas City.",
        "This was July, and the fields\r\nwere green.",
        "One never saw the fields, nor any green thing whatever, in\r\nPackingtown; but one could go out on the road and “hobo it,” as the men\r\nphrased it, and see the country, and have a long rest, and an easy time\r\nriding on the freight cars.",
        "Such was the home to which the new arrivals were welcomed.",
        "There was\r\nnothing better to be had—they might not do so well by looking further,\r\nfor Mrs.",
        "Jukniene had at least kept one room for herself and her three\r\nlittle children, and now offered to share this with the women and the\r\ngirls of the party.",
        "They could get bedding at a secondhand store, she\r\nexplained; and they would not need any, while the weather was so\r\nhot—doubtless they would all sleep on the sidewalk such nights as this,\r\nas did nearly all of her guests.",
        "“Tomorrow,” Jurgis said, when they\r\nwere left alone, “tomorrow I will get a job, and perhaps Jonas will get\r\none also; and then we can get a place of our own.”\r\n\r\nLater that afternoon he and Ona went out to take a walk and look about\r\nthem, to see more of this district which was to be their home.",
        "In back\r\nof the yards the dreary two-story frame houses were scattered farther\r\napart, and there were great spaces bare—that seemingly had been\r\noverlooked by the great sore of a city as it spread itself over the\r\nsurface of the prairie.",
        "These bare places were grown up with dingy,\r\nyellow weeds, hiding innumerable tomato cans; innumerable children\r\nplayed upon them, chasing one another here and there, screaming and\r\nfighting.",
        "The most uncanny thing about this neighborhood was the number\r\nof the children; you thought there must be a school just out, and it\r\nwas only after long acquaintance that you were able to realize that\r\nthere was no school, but that these were the children of the\r\nneighborhood—that there were so many children to the block in\r\nPackingtown that nowhere on its streets could a horse and buggy move\r\nfaster than a walk!",
        "It could not move faster anyhow, on account of the state of the\r\nstreets.",
        "Those through which Jurgis and Ona were walking resembled\r\nstreets less than they did a miniature topographical map.",
        "The roadway\r\nwas commonly several feet lower than the level of the houses, which\r\nwere sometimes joined by high board walks; there were no\r\npavements—there were mountains and valleys and rivers, gullies and\r\nditches, and great hollows full of stinking green water.",
        "In these pools\r\nthe children played, and rolled about in the mud of the streets; here\r\nand there one noticed them digging in it, after trophies which they had\r\nstumbled on.",
        "One wondered about this, as also about the swarms of flies\r\nwhich hung about the scene, literally blackening the air, and the\r\nstrange, fetid odor which assailed one’s nostrils, a ghastly odor, of\r\nall the dead things of the universe.",
        "It impelled the visitor to\r\nquestions and then the residents would explain, quietly, that all this\r\nwas “made” land, and that it had been “made” by using it as a dumping\r\nground for the city garbage.",
        "After a few years the unpleasant effect of\r\nthis would pass away, it was said; but meantime, in hot weather—and\r\nespecially when it rained—the flies were apt to be annoying.",
        "Was it not\r\nunhealthful?",
        "the stranger would ask, and the residents would answer,\r\n“Perhaps; but there is no telling.”\r\n\r\nA little way farther on, and Jurgis and Ona, staring open-eyed and\r\nwondering, came to the place where this “made” ground was in process of\r\nmaking.",
        "Here was a great hole, perhaps two city blocks square, and with\r\nlong files of garbage wagons creeping into it.",
        "The place had an odor\r\nfor which there are no polite words; and it was sprinkled over with\r\nchildren, who raked in it from dawn till dark.",
        "Sometimes visitors from\r\nthe packing houses would wander out to see this “dump,” and they would\r\nstand by and debate as to whether the children were eating the food\r\nthey got, or merely collecting it for the chickens at home.",
        "Apparently\r\nnone of them ever went down to find out.",
        "Beyond this dump there stood a great brickyard, with smoking chimneys.",
        "First they took out the soil to make bricks, and then they filled it up\r\nagain with garbage, which seemed to Jurgis and Ona a felicitous\r\narrangement, characteristic of an enterprising country like America.",
        "A\r\nlittle way beyond was another great hole, which they had emptied and\r\nnot yet filled up.",
        "This held water, and all summer it stood there, with\r\nthe near-by soil draining into it, festering and stewing in the sun;\r\nand then, when winter came, somebody cut the ice on it, and sold it to\r\nthe people of the city.",
        "This, too, seemed to the newcomers an\r\neconomical arrangement; for they did not read the newspapers, and their\r\nheads were not full of troublesome thoughts about “germs.”\r\n\r\nThey stood there while the sun went down upon this scene, and the sky\r\nin the west turned blood-red, and the tops of the houses shone like\r\nfire.",
        "Jurgis and Ona were not thinking of the sunset, however—their\r\nbacks were turned to it, and all their thoughts were of Packingtown,\r\nwhich they could see so plainly in the distance.",
        "The line of the\r\nbuildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out\r\nof the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming\r\naway to the end of the world.",
        "It was a study in colors now, this smoke;\r\nin the sunset light it was black and brown and gray and purple.",
        "All the\r\nsordid suggestions of the place were gone—in the twilight it was a\r\nvision of power.",
        "To the two who stood watching while the darkness\r\nswallowed it up, it seemed a dream of wonder, with its talc of human\r\nenergy, of things being done, of employment for thousands upon\r\nthousands of men, of opportunity and freedom, of life and love and joy.",
        "When they came away, arm in arm, Jurgis was saying, “Tomorrow I shall\r\ngo there and get a job!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his capacity as delicatessen vender, Jokubas Szedvilas had many\r\nacquaintances.",
        "Among these was one of the special policemen employed by\r\nDurham, whose duty it frequently was to pick out men for employment.",
        "Jokubas had never tried it, but he expressed a certainty that he could\r\nget some of his friends a job through this man.",
        "It was agreed, after\r\nconsultation, that he should make the effort with old Antanas and with\r\nJonas.",
        "Jurgis was confident of his ability to get work for himself,\r\nunassisted by any one.",
        "As we have said before, he was not mistaken in\r\nthis.",
        "He had gone to Brown’s and stood there not more than half an hour\r\nbefore one of the bosses noticed his form towering above the rest, and\r\nsignaled to him.",
        "The colloquy which followed was brief and to the\r\npoint:\r\n\r\n“Speak English?”\r\n\r\n“No; Lit-uanian.” (Jurgis had studied this word carefully.)\r\n\r\n“Job?”\r\n\r\n“Je.” (A nod.)\r\n\r\n“Worked here before?”\r\n\r\n“No ’stand.”\r\n\r\n(Signals and gesticulations on the part of the boss.",
        "Vigorous shakes of\r\nthe head by Jurgis.)\r\n\r\n“Shovel guts?”\r\n\r\n“No ’stand.” (More shakes of the head.)\r\n\r\n“Zarnos.",
        "Pagaiksztis.",
        "Szluofa!” (Imitative motions.)\r\n\r\n“Je.”\r\n\r\n“See door.",
        "Durys?” (Pointing.)\r\n\r\n“Je.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, seven o’clock.",
        "Understand?",
        "Rytoj!",
        "Prieszpietys!",
        "Septyni!”\r\n\r\n“Dekui, tamistai!” (Thank you, sir.) And that was all.",
        "Jurgis turned\r\naway, and then in a sudden rush the full realization of his triumph\r\nswept over him, and he gave a yell and a jump, and started off on a\r\nrun.",
        "He had a job!",
        "He had a job!",
        "And he went all the way home as if\r\nupon wings, and burst into the house like a cyclone, to the rage of the\r\nnumerous lodgers who had just turned in for their daily sleep.",
        "Meantime Jokubas had been to see his friend the policeman, and received\r\nencouragement, so it was a happy party.",
        "There being no more to be done\r\nthat day, the shop was left under the care of Lucija, and her husband\r\nsallied forth to show his friends the sights of Packingtown.",
        "Jokubas\r\ndid this with the air of a country gentleman escorting a party of\r\nvisitors over his estate; he was an old-time resident, and all these\r\nwonders had grown up under his eyes, and he had a personal pride in\r\nthem.",
        "The packers might own the land, but he claimed the landscape, and\r\nthere was no one to say nay to this.",
        "They passed down the busy street that led to the yards.",
        "It was still\r\nearly morning, and everything was at its high tide of activity.",
        "A\r\nsteady stream of employees was pouring through the gate—employees of\r\nthe higher sort, at this hour, clerks and stenographers and such.",
        "For\r\nthe women there were waiting big two-horse wagons, which set off at a\r\ngallop as fast as they were filled.",
        "In the distance there was heard\r\nagain the lowing of the cattle, a sound as of a far-off ocean calling.",
        "They followed it, this time, as eager as children in sight of a circus\r\nmenagerie—which, indeed, the scene a good deal resembled.",
        "They crossed\r\nthe railroad tracks, and then on each side of the street were the pens\r\nfull of cattle; they would have stopped to look, but Jokubas hurried\r\nthem on, to where there was a stairway and a raised gallery, from which\r\neverything could be seen.",
        "Here they stood, staring, breathless with\r\nwonder.",
        "There is over a square mile of space in the yards, and more than half\r\nof it is occupied by cattle pens; north and south as far as the eye can\r\nreach there stretches a sea of pens.",
        "And they were all filled—so many\r\ncattle no one had ever dreamed existed in the world.",
        "Red cattle, black,\r\nwhite, and yellow cattle; old cattle and young cattle; great bellowing\r\nbulls and little calves not an hour born; meek-eyed milch cows and\r\nfierce, long-horned Texas steers.",
        "The sound of them here was as of all\r\nthe barnyards of the universe; and as for counting them—it would have\r\ntaken all day simply to count the pens.",
        "Here and there ran long alleys,\r\nblocked at intervals by gates; and Jokubas told them that the number of\r\nthese gates was twenty-five thousand.",
        "Jokubas had recently been reading\r\na newspaper article which was full of statistics such as that, and he\r\nwas very proud as he repeated them and made his guests cry out with\r\nwonder.",
        "Jurgis too had a little of this sense of pride.",
        "Had he not just\r\ngotten a job, and become a sharer in all this activity, a cog in this\r\nmarvelous machine?",
        "Here and there about the alleys galloped men upon\r\nhorseback, booted, and carrying long whips; they were very busy,\r\ncalling to each other, and to those who were driving the cattle.",
        "They\r\nwere drovers and stock raisers, who had come from far states, and\r\nbrokers and commission merchants, and buyers for all the big packing\r\nhouses.",
        "Here and there they would stop to inspect a bunch of cattle, and there\r\nwould be a parley, brief and businesslike.",
        "The buyer would nod or drop\r\nhis whip, and that would mean a bargain; and he would note it in his\r\nlittle book, along with hundreds of others he had made that morning.",
        "Then Jokubas pointed out the place where the cattle were driven to be\r\nweighed, upon a great scale that would weigh a hundred thousand pounds\r\nat once and record it automatically.",
        "It was near to the east entrance\r\nthat they stood, and all along this east side of the yards ran the\r\nrailroad tracks, into which the cars were run, loaded with cattle.",
        "All\r\nnight long this had been going on, and now the pens were full; by\r\ntonight they would all be empty, and the same thing would be done\r\nagain.",
        "“And what will become of all these creatures?” cried Teta Elzbieta.",
        "“By tonight,” Jokubas answered, “they will all be killed and cut up;\r\nand over there on the other side of the packing houses are more\r\nrailroad tracks, where the cars come to take them away.”\r\n\r\nThere were two hundred and fifty miles of track within the yards, their\r\nguide went on to tell them.",
        "They brought about ten thousand head of\r\ncattle every day, and as many hogs, and half as many sheep—which meant\r\nsome eight or ten million live creatures turned into food every year.",
        "One stood and watched, and little by little caught the drift of the\r\ntide, as it set in the direction of the packing houses.",
        "There were\r\ngroups of cattle being driven to the chutes, which were roadways about\r\nfifteen feet wide, raised high above the pens.",
        "In these chutes the\r\nstream of animals was continuous; it was quite uncanny to watch them,\r\npressing on to their fate, all unsuspicious a very river of death.",
        "Our\r\nfriends were not poetical, and the sight suggested to them no metaphors\r\nof human destiny; they thought only of the wonderful efficiency of it\r\nall.",
        "The chutes into which the hogs went climbed high up—to the very\r\ntop of the distant buildings; and Jokubas explained that the hogs went\r\nup by the power of their own legs, and then their weight carried them\r\nback through all the processes necessary to make them into pork.",
        "“They don’t waste anything here,” said the guide, and then he laughed\r\nand added a witticism, which he was pleased that his unsophisticated\r\nfriends should take to be his own: “They use everything about the hog\r\nexcept the squeal.” In front of Brown’s General Office building there\r\ngrows a tiny plot of grass, and this, you may learn, is the only bit of\r\ngreen thing in Packingtown; likewise this jest about the hog and his\r\nsqueal, the stock in trade of all the guides, is the one gleam of humor\r\nthat you will find there.",
        "After they had seen enough of the pens, the party went up the street,\r\nto the mass of buildings which occupy the center of the yards.",
        "These\r\nbuildings, made of brick and stained with innumerable layers of\r\nPackingtown smoke, were painted all over with advertising signs, from\r\nwhich the visitor realized suddenly that he had come to the home of\r\nmany of the torments of his life.",
        "It was here that they made those\r\nproducts with the wonders of which they pestered him so—by placards\r\nthat defaced the landscape when he traveled, and by staring\r\nadvertisements in the newspapers and magazines—by silly little jingles\r\nthat he could not get out of his mind, and gaudy pictures that lurked\r\nfor him around every street corner.",
        "Here was where they made Brown’s\r\nImperial Hams and Bacon, Brown’s Dressed Beef, Brown’s Excelsior\r\nSausages!",
        "Here was the headquarters of Durham’s Pure Leaf Lard, of\r\nDurham’s Breakfast Bacon, Durham’s Canned Beef, Potted Ham, Deviled\r\nChicken, Peerless Fertilizer!",
        "Entering one of the Durham buildings, they found a number of other\r\nvisitors waiting; and before long there came a guide, to escort them\r\nthrough the place.",
        "They make a great feature of showing strangers\r\nthrough the packing plants, for it is a good advertisement.",
        "But Ponas\r\nJokubas whispered maliciously that the visitors did not see any more\r\nthan the packers wanted them to.",
        "They climbed a long series of\r\nstairways outside of the building, to the top of its five or six\r\nstories.",
        "Here was the chute, with its river of hogs, all patiently\r\ntoiling upward; there was a place for them to rest to cool off, and\r\nthen through another passageway they went into a room from which there\r\nis no returning for hogs.",
        "It was a long, narrow room, with a gallery along it for visitors.",
        "At\r\nthe head there was a great iron wheel, about twenty feet in\r\ncircumference, with rings here and there along its edge.",
        "Upon both\r\nsides of this wheel there was a narrow space, into which came the hogs\r\nat the end of their journey; in the midst of them stood a great burly\r\nNegro, bare-armed and bare-chested.",
        "He was resting for the moment, for\r\nthe wheel had stopped while men were cleaning up.",
        "In a minute or two,\r\nhowever, it began slowly to revolve, and then the men upon each side of\r\nit sprang to work.",
        "They had chains which they fastened about the leg of\r\nthe nearest hog, and the other end of the chain they hooked into one of\r\nthe rings upon the wheel.",
        "So, as the wheel turned, a hog was suddenly\r\njerked off his feet and borne aloft.",
        "At the same instant the car was assailed by a most terrifying shriek;\r\nthe visitors started in alarm, the women turned pale and shrank back.",
        "The shriek was followed by another, louder and yet more agonizing—for\r\nonce started upon that journey, the hog never came back; at the top of\r\nthe wheel he was shunted off upon a trolley, and went sailing down the\r\nroom.",
        "And meantime another was swung up, and then another, and another,\r\nuntil there was a double line of them, each dangling by a foot and\r\nkicking in frenzy—and squealing.",
        "The uproar was appalling, perilous to\r\nthe eardrums; one feared there was too much sound for the room to\r\nhold—that the walls must give way or the ceiling crack.",
        "There were high\r\nsqueals and low squeals, grunts, and wails of agony; there would come a\r\nmomentary lull, and then a fresh outburst, louder than ever, surging up\r\nto a deafening climax.",
        "It was too much for some of the visitors—the men\r\nwould look at each other, laughing nervously, and the women would stand\r\nwith hands clenched, and the blood rushing to their faces, and the\r\ntears starting in their eyes.",
        "Meantime, heedless of all these things, the men upon the floor were\r\ngoing about their work.",
        "Neither squeals of hogs nor tears of visitors\r\nmade any difference to them; one by one they hooked up the hogs, and\r\none by one with a swift stroke they slit their throats.",
        "There was a\r\nlong line of hogs, with squeals and lifeblood ebbing away together;\r\nuntil at last each started again, and vanished with a splash into a\r\nhuge vat of boiling water.",
        "It was all so very businesslike that one watched it fascinated.",
        "It was\r\nporkmaking by machinery, porkmaking by applied mathematics.",
        "And yet\r\nsomehow the most matter-of-fact person could not help thinking of the\r\nhogs; they were so innocent, they came so very trustingly; and they\r\nwere so very human in their protests—and so perfectly within their\r\nrights!",
        "They had done nothing to deserve it; and it was adding insult\r\nto injury, as the thing was done here, swinging them up in this\r\ncold-blooded, impersonal way, without a pretense of apology, without\r\nthe homage of a tear.",
        "Now and then a visitor wept, to be sure; but this\r\nslaughtering machine ran on, visitors or no visitors.",
        "It was like some\r\nhorrible crime committed in a dungeon, all unseen and unheeded, buried\r\nout of sight and of memory.",
        "One could not stand and watch very long without becoming philosophical,\r\nwithout beginning to deal in symbols and similes, and to hear the hog\r\nsqueal of the universe.",
        "Was it permitted to believe that there was\r\nnowhere upon the earth, or above the earth, a heaven for hogs, where\r\nthey were requited for all this suffering?",
        "Each one of these hogs was a\r\nseparate creature.",
        "Some were white hogs, some were black; some were\r\nbrown, some were spotted; some were old, some young; some were long and\r\nlean, some were monstrous.",
        "And each of them had an individuality of his\r\nown, a will of his own, a hope and a heart’s desire; each was full of\r\nself-confidence, of self-importance, and a sense of dignity.",
        "And\r\ntrusting and strong in faith he had gone about his business, the while\r\na black shadow hung over him and a horrid Fate waited in his pathway.",
        "Now suddenly it had swooped upon him, and had seized him by the leg.",
        "Relentless, remorseless, it was; all his protests, his screams, were\r\nnothing to it—it did its cruel will with him, as if his wishes, his\r\nfeelings, had simply no existence at all; it cut his throat and watched\r\nhim gasp out his life.",
        "And now was one to believe that there was\r\nnowhere a god of hogs, to whom this hog personality was precious, to\r\nwhom these hog squeals and agonies had a meaning?",
        "Who would take this\r\nhog into his arms and comfort him, reward him for his work well done,\r\nand show him the meaning of his sacrifice?",
        "Perhaps some glimpse of all\r\nthis was in the thoughts of our humble-minded Jurgis, as he turned to\r\ngo on with the rest of the party, and muttered: “Dieve—but I’m glad I’m\r\nnot a hog!”\r\n\r\nThe carcass hog was scooped out of the vat by machinery, and then it\r\nfell to the second floor, passing on the way through a wonderful\r\nmachine with numerous scrapers, which adjusted themselves to the size\r\nand shape of the animal, and sent it out at the other end with nearly\r\nall of its bristles removed.",
        "It was then again strung up by machinery,\r\nand sent upon another trolley ride; this time passing between two lines\r\nof men, who sat upon a raised platform, each doing a certain single\r\nthing to the carcass as it came to him.",
        "One scraped the outside of a\r\nleg; another scraped the inside of the same leg.",
        "One with a swift\r\nstroke cut the throat; another with two swift strokes severed the head,\r\nwhich fell to the floor and vanished through a hole.",
        "Another made a\r\nslit down the body; a second opened the body wider; a third with a saw\r\ncut the breastbone; a fourth loosened the entrails; a fifth pulled them\r\nout—and they also slid through a hole in the floor.",
        "There were men to\r\nscrape each side and men to scrape the back; there were men to clean\r\nthe carcass inside, to trim it and wash it.",
        "Looking down this room, one\r\nsaw, creeping slowly, a line of dangling hogs a hundred yards in\r\nlength; and for every yard there was a man, working as if a demon were\r\nafter him.",
        "At the end of this hog’s progress every inch of the carcass\r\nhad been gone over several times; and then it was rolled into the\r\nchilling room, where it stayed for twenty-four hours, and where a\r\nstranger might lose himself in a forest of freezing hogs.",
        "Before the carcass was admitted here, however, it had to pass a\r\ngovernment inspector, who sat in the doorway and felt of the glands in\r\nthe neck for tuberculosis.",
        "This government inspector did not have the\r\nmanner of a man who was worked to death; he was apparently not haunted\r\nby a fear that the hog might get by him before he had finished his\r\ntesting.",
        "If you were a sociable person, he was quite willing to enter\r\ninto conversation with you, and to explain to you the deadly nature of\r\nthe ptomaines which are found in tubercular pork; and while he was\r\ntalking with you you could hardly be so ungrateful as to notice that a\r\ndozen carcasses were passing him untouched.",
        "This inspector wore a blue\r\nuniform, with brass buttons, and he gave an atmosphere of authority to\r\nthe scene, and, as it were, put the stamp of official approval upon the\r\nthings which were done in Durham’s.",
        "Jurgis went down the line with the rest of the visitors, staring\r\nopen-mouthed, lost in wonder.",
        "He had dressed hogs himself in the forest\r\nof Lithuania; but he had never expected to live to see one hog dressed\r\nby several hundred men.",
        "It was like a wonderful poem to him, and he\r\ntook it all in guilelessly—even to the conspicuous signs demanding\r\nimmaculate cleanliness of the employees.",
        "Jurgis was vexed when the\r\ncynical Jokubas translated these signs with sarcastic comments,\r\noffering to take them to the secret rooms where the spoiled meats went\r\nto be doctored.",
        "The party descended to the next floor, where the various waste\r\nmaterials were treated.",
        "Here came the entrails, to be scraped and\r\nwashed clean for sausage casings; men and women worked here in the\r\nmidst of a sickening stench, which caused the visitors to hasten by,\r\ngasping.",
        "To another room came all the scraps to be “tanked,” which\r\nmeant boiling and pumping off the grease to make soap and lard; below\r\nthey took out the refuse, and this, too, was a region in which the\r\nvisitors did not linger.",
        "In still other places men were engaged in\r\ncutting up the carcasses that had been through the chilling rooms.",
        "First there were the “splitters,” the most expert workmen in the plant,\r\nwho earned as high as fifty cents an hour, and did not a thing all day\r\nexcept chop hogs down the middle.",
        "Then there were “cleaver men,” great\r\ngiants with muscles of iron; each had two men to attend him—to slide\r\nthe half carcass in front of him on the table, and hold it while he\r\nchopped it, and then turn each piece so that he might chop it once\r\nmore.",
        "His cleaver had a blade about two feet long, and he never made\r\nbut one cut; he made it so neatly, too, that his implement did not\r\nsmite through and dull itself—there was just enough force for a perfect\r\ncut, and no more.",
        "So through various yawning holes there slipped to the\r\nfloor below—to one room hams, to another forequarters, to another sides\r\nof pork.",
        "One might go down to this floor and see the pickling rooms,\r\nwhere the hams were put into vats, and the great smoke rooms, with\r\ntheir airtight iron doors.",
        "In other rooms they prepared salt pork—there\r\nwere whole cellars full of it, built up in great towers to the ceiling.",
        "In yet other rooms they were putting up meats in boxes and barrels, and\r\nwrapping hams and bacon in oiled paper, sealing and labeling and sewing\r\nthem.",
        "From the doors of these rooms went men with loaded trucks, to the\r\nplatform where freight cars were waiting to be filled; and one went out\r\nthere and realized with a start that he had come at last to the ground\r\nfloor of this enormous building.",
        "Then the party went across the street to where they did the killing of\r\nbeef—where every hour they turned four or five hundred cattle into\r\nmeat.",
        "Unlike the place they had left, all this work was done on one\r\nfloor; and instead of there being one line of carcasses which moved to\r\nthe workmen, there were fifteen or twenty lines, and the men moved from\r\none to another of these.",
        "This made a scene of intense activity, a\r\npicture of human power wonderful to watch.",
        "It was all in one great\r\nroom, like a circus amphitheater, with a gallery for visitors running\r\nover the center.",
        "Along one side of the room ran a narrow gallery, a few feet from the\r\nfloor; into which gallery the cattle were driven by men with goads\r\nwhich gave them electric shocks.",
        "Once crowded in here, the creatures\r\nwere prisoned, each in a separate pen, by gates that shut, leaving them\r\nno room to turn around; and while they stood bellowing and plunging,\r\nover the top of the pen there leaned one of the “knockers,” armed with\r\na sledge hammer, and watching for a chance to deal a blow.",
        "The room\r\nechoed with the thuds in quick succession, and the stamping and kicking\r\nof the steers.",
        "The instant the animal had fallen, the “knocker” passed\r\non to another; while a second man raised a lever, and the side of the\r\npen was raised, and the animal, still kicking and struggling, slid out\r\nto the “killing bed.” Here a man put shackles about one leg, and\r\npressed another lever, and the body was jerked up into the air.",
        "There\r\nwere fifteen or twenty such pens, and it was a matter of only a couple\r\nof minutes to knock fifteen or twenty cattle and roll them out.",
        "Then\r\nonce more the gates were opened, and another lot rushed in; and so out\r\nof each pen there rolled a steady stream of carcasses, which the men\r\nupon the killing beds had to get out of the way.",
        "The manner in which they did this was something to be seen and never\r\nforgotten.",
        "They worked with furious intensity, literally upon the\r\nrun—at a pace with which there is nothing to be compared except a\r\nfootball game.",
        "It was all highly specialized labor, each man having his\r\ntask to do; generally this would consist of only two or three specific\r\ncuts, and he would pass down the line of fifteen or twenty carcasses,\r\nmaking these cuts upon each.",
        "First there came the “butcher,” to bleed\r\nthem; this meant one swift stroke, so swift that you could not see\r\nit—only the flash of the knife; and before you could realize it, the\r\nman had darted on to the next line, and a stream of bright red was\r\npouring out upon the floor.",
        "This floor was half an inch deep with\r\nblood, in spite of the best efforts of men who kept shoveling it\r\nthrough holes; it must have made the floor slippery, but no one could\r\nhave guessed this by watching the men at work.",
        "The carcass hung for a few minutes to bleed; there was no time lost,\r\nhowever, for there were several hanging in each line, and one was\r\nalways ready.",
        "It was let down to the ground, and there came the\r\n“headsman,” whose task it was to sever the head, with two or three\r\nswift strokes.",
        "Then came the “floorsman,” to make the first cut in the\r\nskin; and then another to finish ripping the skin down the center; and\r\nthen half a dozen more in swift succession, to finish the skinning.",
        "After they were through, the carcass was again swung up; and while a\r\nman with a stick examined the skin, to make sure that it had not been\r\ncut, and another rolled it up and tumbled it through one of the\r\ninevitable holes in the floor, the beef proceeded on its journey.",
        "There\r\nwere men to cut it, and men to split it, and men to gut it and scrape\r\nit clean inside.",
        "There were some with hose which threw jets of boiling\r\nwater upon it, and others who removed the feet and added the final\r\ntouches.",
        "In the end, as with the hogs, the finished beef was run into\r\nthe chilling room, to hang its appointed time.",
        "The visitors were taken there and shown them, all neatly hung in rows,\r\nlabeled conspicuously with the tags of the government inspectors—and\r\nsome, which had been killed by a special process, marked with the sign\r\nof the kosher rabbi, certifying that it was fit for sale to the\r\northodox.",
        "And then the visitors were taken to the other parts of the\r\nbuilding, to see what became of each particle of the waste material\r\nthat had vanished through the floor; and to the pickling rooms, and the\r\nsalting rooms, the canning rooms, and the packing rooms, where choice\r\nmeat was prepared for shipping in refrigerator cars, destined to be\r\neaten in all the four corners of civilization.",
        "Afterward they went\r\noutside, wandering about among the mazes of buildings in which was done\r\nthe work auxiliary to this great industry.",
        "There was scarcely a thing\r\nneeded in the business that Durham and Company did not make for\r\nthemselves.",
        "There was a great steam power plant and an electricity\r\nplant.",
        "There was a barrel factory, and a boiler-repair shop.",
        "There was\r\na building to which the grease was piped, and made into soap and lard;\r\nand then there was a factory for making lard cans, and another for\r\nmaking soap boxes.",
        "There was a building in which the bristles were\r\ncleaned and dried, for the making of hair cushions and such things;\r\nthere was a building where the skins were dried and tanned, there was\r\nanother where heads and feet were made into glue, and another where\r\nbones were made into fertilizer.",
        "No tiniest particle of organic matter\r\nwas wasted in Durham’s.",
        "Out of the horns of the cattle they made combs,\r\nbuttons, hairpins, and imitation ivory; out of the shinbones and other\r\nbig bones they cut knife and toothbrush handles, and mouthpieces for\r\npipes; out of the hoofs they cut hairpins and buttons, before they made\r\nthe rest into glue.",
        "From such things as feet, knuckles, hide clippings,\r\nand sinews came such strange and unlikely products as gelatin,\r\nisinglass, and phosphorus, bone black, shoe blacking, and bone oil.",
        "They had curled-hair works for the cattle tails, and a “wool pullery”\r\nfor the sheepskins; they made pepsin from the stomachs of the pigs, and\r\nalbumen from the blood, and violin strings from the ill-smelling\r\nentrails.",
        "When there was nothing else to be done with a thing, they\r\nfirst put it into a tank and got out of it all the tallow and grease,\r\nand then they made it into fertilizer.",
        "All these industries were\r\ngathered into buildings near by, connected by galleries and railroads\r\nwith the main establishment; and it was estimated that they had handled\r\nnearly a quarter of a billion of animals since the founding of the\r\nplant by the elder Durham a generation and more ago.",
        "If you counted\r\nwith it the other big plants—and they were now really all one—it was,\r\nso Jokubas informed them, the greatest aggregation of labor and capital\r\never gathered in one place.",
        "It employed thirty thousand men; it\r\nsupported directly two hundred and fifty thousand people in its\r\nneighborhood, and indirectly it supported half a million.",
        "It sent its\r\nproducts to every country in the civilized world, and it furnished the\r\nfood for no less than thirty million people!",
        "To all of these things our friends would listen open-mouthed—it seemed\r\nto them impossible of belief that anything so stupendous could have\r\nbeen devised by mortal man.",
        "That was why to Jurgis it seemed almost\r\nprofanity to speak about the place as did Jokubas, skeptically; it was\r\na thing as tremendous as the universe—the laws and ways of its working\r\nno more than the universe to be questioned or understood.",
        "All that a\r\nmere man could do, it seemed to Jurgis, was to take a thing like this\r\nas he found it, and do as he was told; to be given a place in it and a\r\nshare in its wonderful activities was a blessing to be grateful for, as\r\none was grateful for the sunshine and the rain.",
        "Jurgis was even glad\r\nthat he had not seen the place before meeting with his triumph, for he\r\nfelt that the size of it would have overwhelmed him.",
        "But now he had\r\nbeen admitted—he was a part of it all!",
        "He had the feeling that this\r\nwhole huge establishment had taken him under its protection, and had\r\nbecome responsible for his welfare.",
        "So guileless was he, and ignorant\r\nof the nature of business, that he did not even realize that he had\r\nbecome an employee of Brown’s, and that Brown and Durham were supposed\r\nby all the world to be deadly rivals—were even required to be deadly\r\nrivals by the law of the land, and ordered to try to ruin each other\r\nunder penalty of fine and imprisonment!",
        "CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nPromptly at seven the next morning Jurgis reported for work.",
        "He came to\r\nthe door that had been pointed out to him, and there he waited for\r\nnearly two hours.",
        "The boss had meant for him to enter, but had not said\r\nthis, and so it was only when on his way out to hire another man that\r\nhe came upon Jurgis.",
        "He gave him a good cursing, but as Jurgis did not\r\nunderstand a word of it he did not object.",
        "He followed the boss, who\r\nshowed him where to put his street clothes, and waited while he donned\r\nthe working clothes he had bought in a secondhand shop and brought with\r\nhim in a bundle; then he led him to the “killing beds.” The work which\r\nJurgis was to do here was very simple, and it took him but a few\r\nminutes to learn it.",
        "He was provided with a stiff besom, such as is\r\nused by street sweepers, and it was his place to follow down the line\r\nthe man who drew out the smoking entrails from the carcass of the\r\nsteer; this mass was to be swept into a trap, which was then closed, so\r\nthat no one might slip into it.",
        "As Jurgis came in, the first cattle of\r\nthe morning were just making their appearance; and so, with scarcely\r\ntime to look about him, and none to speak to any one, he fell to work.",
        "It was a sweltering day in July, and the place ran with steaming hot\r\nblood—one waded in it on the floor.",
        "The stench was almost overpowering,\r\nbut to Jurgis it was nothing.",
        "His whole soul was dancing with joy—he\r\nwas at work at last!",
        "He was at work and earning money!",
        "All day long he\r\nwas figuring to himself.",
        "He was paid the fabulous sum of seventeen and\r\na half cents an hour; and as it proved a rush day and he worked until\r\nnearly seven o’clock in the evening, he went home to the family with\r\nthe tidings that he had earned more than a dollar and a half in a\r\nsingle day!",
        "At home, also, there was more good news; so much of it at once that\r\nthere was quite a celebration in Aniele’s hall bedroom.",
        "Jonas had been\r\nto have an interview with the special policeman to whom Szedvilas had\r\nintroduced him, and had been taken to see several of the bosses, with\r\nthe result that one had promised him a job the beginning of the next\r\nweek.",
        "And then there was Marija Berczynskas, who, fired with jealousy\r\nby the success of Jurgis, had set out upon her own responsibility to\r\nget a place.",
        "Marija had nothing to take with her save her two brawny\r\narms and the word “job,” laboriously learned; but with these she had\r\nmarched about Packingtown all day, entering every door where there were\r\nsigns of activity.",
        "Out of some she had been ordered with curses; but\r\nMarija was not afraid of man or devil, and asked every one she\r\nsaw—visitors and strangers, or work-people like herself, and once or\r\ntwice even high and lofty office personages, who stared at her as if\r\nthey thought she was crazy.",
        "In the end, however, she had reaped her\r\nreward.",
        "In one of the smaller plants she had stumbled upon a room where\r\nscores of women and girls were sitting at long tables preparing smoked\r\nbeef in cans; and wandering through room after room, Marija came at\r\nlast to the place where the sealed cans were being painted and labeled,\r\nand here she had the good fortune to encounter the “forelady.” Marija\r\ndid not understand then, as she was destined to understand later, what\r\nthere was attractive to a “forelady” about the combination of a face\r\nfull of boundless good nature and the muscles of a dray horse; but the\r\nwoman had told her to come the next day and she would perhaps give her\r\na chance to learn the trade of painting cans.",
        "The painting of cans\r\nbeing skilled piecework, and paying as much as two dollars a day,\r\nMarija burst in upon the family with the yell of a Comanche Indian, and\r\nfell to capering about the room so as to frighten the baby almost into\r\nconvulsions.",
        "Better luck than all this could hardly have been hoped for; there was\r\nonly one of them left to seek a place.",
        "Jurgis was determined that Teta\r\nElzbieta should stay at home to keep house, and that Ona should help\r\nher.",
        "He would not have Ona working—he was not that sort of a man, he\r\nsaid, and she was not that sort of a woman.",
        "It would be a strange thing\r\nif a man like him could not support the family, with the help of the\r\nboard of Jonas and Marija.",
        "He would not even hear of letting the\r\nchildren go to work—there were schools here in America for children,\r\nJurgis had heard, to which they could go for nothing.",
        "That the priest\r\nwould object to these schools was something of which he had as yet no\r\nidea, and for the present his mind was made up that the children of\r\nTeta Elzbieta should have as fair a chance as any other children.",
        "The\r\noldest of them, little Stanislovas, was but thirteen, and small for his\r\nage at that; and while the oldest son of Szedvilas was only twelve, and\r\nhad worked for over a year at Jones’s, Jurgis would have it that\r\nStanislovas should learn to speak English, and grow up to be a skilled\r\nman.",
        "So there was only old Dede Antanas; Jurgis would have had him rest too,\r\nbut he was forced to acknowledge that this was not possible, and,\r\nbesides, the old man would not hear it spoken of—it was his whim to\r\ninsist that he was as lively as any boy.",
        "He had come to America as full\r\nof hope as the best of them; and now he was the chief problem that\r\nworried his son.",
        "For every one that Jurgis spoke to assured him that it\r\nwas a waste of time to seek employment for the old man in Packingtown.",
        "Szedvilas told him that the packers did not even keep the men who had\r\ngrown old in their own service—to say nothing of taking on new ones.",
        "And not only was it the rule here, it was the rule everywhere in\r\nAmerica, so far as he knew.",
        "To satisfy Jurgis he had asked the\r\npoliceman, and brought back the message that the thing was not to be\r\nthought of.",
        "They had not told this to old Anthony, who had consequently\r\nspent the two days wandering about from one part of the yards to\r\nanother, and had now come home to hear about the triumph of the others,\r\nsmiling bravely and saying that it would be his turn another day.",
        "Their good luck, they felt, had given them the right to think about a\r\nhome; and sitting out on the doorstep that summer evening, they held\r\nconsultation about it, and Jurgis took occasion to broach a weighty\r\nsubject.",
        "Passing down the avenue to work that morning he had seen two\r\nboys leaving an advertisement from house to house; and seeing that\r\nthere were pictures upon it, Jurgis had asked for one, and had rolled\r\nit up and tucked it into his shirt.",
        "At noontime a man with whom he had\r\nbeen talking had read it to him and told him a little about it, with\r\nthe result that Jurgis had conceived a wild idea.",
        "He brought out the placard, which was quite a work of art.",
        "It was\r\nnearly two feet long, printed on calendered paper, with a selection of\r\ncolors so bright that they shone even in the moonlight.",
        "The center of\r\nthe placard was occupied by a house, brilliantly painted, new, and\r\ndazzling.",
        "The roof of it was of a purple hue, and trimmed with gold;\r\nthe house itself was silvery, and the doors and windows red.",
        "It was a\r\ntwo-story building, with a porch in front, and a very fancy scrollwork\r\naround the edges; it was complete in every tiniest detail, even the\r\ndoorknob, and there was a hammock on the porch and white lace curtains\r\nin the windows.",
        "Underneath this, in one corner, was a picture of a\r\nhusband and wife in loving embrace; in the opposite corner was a\r\ncradle, with fluffy curtains drawn over it, and a smiling cherub\r\nhovering upon silver-colored wings.",
        "For fear that the significance of\r\nall this should be lost, there was a label, in Polish, Lithuanian, and\r\nGerman—“_Dom.",
        "Namai.",
        "Heim._” “Why pay rent?” the linguistic circular\r\nwent on to demand.",
        "“Why not own your own home?",
        "Do you know that you can\r\nbuy one for less than your rent?",
        "We have built thousands of homes which\r\nare now occupied by happy families.”—So it became eloquent, picturing\r\nthe blissfulness of married life in a house with nothing to pay.",
        "It\r\neven quoted “Home, Sweet Home,” and made bold to translate it into\r\nPolish—though for some reason it omitted the Lithuanian of this.",
        "Perhaps the translator found it a difficult matter to be sentimental in\r\na language in which a sob is known as a gukcziojimas and a smile as a\r\nnusiszypsojimas.",
        "Over this document the family pored long, while Ona spelled out its\r\ncontents.",
        "It appeared that this house contained four rooms, besides a\r\nbasement, and that it might be bought for fifteen hundred dollars, the\r\nlot and all.",
        "Of this, only three hundred dollars had to be paid down,\r\nthe balance being paid at the rate of twelve dollars a month.",
        "These\r\nwere frightful sums, but then they were in America, where people talked\r\nabout such without fear.",
        "They had learned that they would have to pay a\r\nrent of nine dollars a month for a flat, and there was no way of doing\r\nbetter, unless the family of twelve was to exist in one or two rooms,\r\nas at present.",
        "If they paid rent, of course, they might pay forever,\r\nand be no better off; whereas, if they could only meet the extra\r\nexpense in the beginning, there would at last come a time when they\r\nwould not have any rent to pay for the rest of their lives.",
        "They figured it up.",
        "There was a little left of the money belonging to\r\nTeta Elzbieta, and there was a little left to Jurgis.",
        "Marija had about\r\nfifty dollars pinned up somewhere in her stockings, and Grandfather\r\nAnthony had part of the money he had gotten for his farm.",
        "If they all\r\ncombined, they would have enough to make the first payment; and if they\r\nhad employment, so that they could be sure of the future, it might\r\nreally prove the best plan.",
        "It was, of course, not a thing even to be\r\ntalked of lightly; it was a thing they would have to sift to the\r\nbottom.",
        "And yet, on the other hand, if they were going to make the\r\nventure, the sooner they did it the better, for were they not paying\r\nrent all the time, and living in a most horrible way besides?",
        "Jurgis\r\nwas used to dirt—there was nothing could scare a man who had been with\r\na railroad gang, where one could gather up the fleas off the floor of\r\nthe sleeping room by the handful.",
        "But that sort of thing would not do\r\nfor Ona.",
        "They must have a better place of some sort soon—Jurgis said it\r\nwith all the assurance of a man who had just made a dollar and\r\nfifty-seven cents in a single day.",
        "Jurgis was at a loss to understand\r\nwhy, with wages as they were, so many of the people of this district\r\nshould live the way they did.",
        "The next day Marija went to see her “forelady,” and was told to report\r\nthe first of the week, and learn the business of can-painter.",
        "Marija\r\nwent home, singing out loud all the way, and was just in time to join\r\nOna and her stepmother as they were setting out to go and make inquiry\r\nconcerning the house.",
        "That evening the three made their report to the\r\nmen—the thing was altogether as represented in the circular, or at any\r\nrate so the agent had said.",
        "The houses lay to the south, about a mile\r\nand a half from the yards; they were wonderful bargains, the gentleman\r\nhad assured them—personally, and for their own good.",
        "He could do this,\r\nso he explained to them, for the reason that he had himself no interest\r\nin their sale—he was merely the agent for a company that had built\r\nthem.",
        "These were the last, and the company was going out of business,\r\nso if any one wished to take advantage of this wonderful no-rent plan,\r\nhe would have to be very quick.",
        "As a matter of fact there was just a\r\nlittle uncertainty as to whether there was a single house left; for the\r\nagent had taken so many people to see them, and for all he knew the\r\ncompany might have parted with the last.",
        "Seeing Teta Elzbieta’s evident\r\ngrief at this news, he added, after some hesitation, that if they\r\nreally intended to make a purchase, he would send a telephone message\r\nat his own expense, and have one of the houses kept.",
        "So it had finally\r\nbeen arranged—and they were to go and make an inspection the following\r\nSunday morning.",
        "That was Thursday; and all the rest of the week the killing gang at\r\nBrown’s worked at full pressure, and Jurgis cleared a dollar\r\nseventy-five every day.",
        "That was at the rate of ten and one-half\r\ndollars a week, or forty-five a month.",
        "Jurgis was not able to figure,\r\nexcept it was a very simple sum, but Ona was like lightning at such\r\nthings, and she worked out the problem for the family.",
        "Marija and Jonas\r\nwere each to pay sixteen dollars a month board, and the old man\r\ninsisted that he could do the same as soon as he got a place—which\r\nmight be any day now.",
        "That would make ninety-three dollars.",
        "Then Marija\r\nand Jonas were between them to take a third share in the house, which\r\nwould leave only eight dollars a month for Jurgis to contribute to the\r\npayment.",
        "So they would have eighty-five dollars a month—or, supposing\r\nthat Dede Antanas did not get work at once, seventy dollars a\r\nmonth—which ought surely to be sufficient for the support of a family\r\nof twelve.",
        "An hour before the time on Sunday morning the entire party set out.",
        "They had the address written on a piece of paper, which they showed to\r\nsome one now and then.",
        "It proved to be a long mile and a half, but they\r\nwalked it, and half an hour or so later the agent put in an appearance.",
        "He was a smooth and florid personage, elegantly dressed, and he spoke\r\ntheir language freely, which gave him a great advantage in dealing with\r\nthem.",
        "He escorted them to the house, which was one of a long row of the\r\ntypical frame dwellings of the neighborhood, where architecture is a\r\nluxury that is dispensed with.",
        "Ona’s heart sank, for the house was not\r\nas it was shown in the picture; the color scheme was different, for one\r\nthing, and then it did not seem quite so big.",
        "Still, it was freshly\r\npainted, and made a considerable show.",
        "It was all brand-new, so the\r\nagent told them, but he talked so incessantly that they were quite\r\nconfused, and did not have time to ask many questions.",
        "There were all\r\nsorts of things they had made up their minds to inquire about, but when\r\nthe time came, they either forgot them or lacked the courage.",
        "The other\r\nhouses in the row did not seem to be new, and few of them seemed to be\r\noccupied.",
        "When they ventured to hint at this, the agent’s reply was\r\nthat the purchasers would be moving in shortly.",
        "To press the matter\r\nwould have seemed to be doubting his word, and never in their lives had\r\nany one of them ever spoken to a person of the class called “gentleman”\r\nexcept with deference and humility.",
        "The house had a basement, about two feet below the street line, and a\r\nsingle story, about six feet above it, reached by a flight of steps.",
        "In\r\naddition there was an attic, made by the peak of the roof, and having\r\none small window in each end.",
        "The street in front of the house was\r\nunpaved and unlighted, and the view from it consisted of a few exactly\r\nsimilar houses, scattered here and there upon lots grown up with dingy\r\nbrown weeds.",
        "The house inside contained four rooms, plastered white;\r\nthe basement was but a frame, the walls being unplastered and the floor\r\nnot laid.",
        "The agent explained that the houses were built that way, as\r\nthe purchasers generally preferred to finish the basements to suit\r\ntheir own taste.",
        "The attic was also unfinished—the family had been\r\nfiguring that in case of an emergency they could rent this attic, but\r\nthey found that there was not even a floor, nothing but joists, and\r\nbeneath them the lath and plaster of the ceiling below.",
        "All of this,\r\nhowever, did not chill their ardor as much as might have been expected,\r\nbecause of the volubility of the agent.",
        "There was no end to the\r\nadvantages of the house, as he set them forth, and he was not silent\r\nfor an instant; he showed them everything, down to the locks on the\r\ndoors and the catches on the windows, and how to work them.",
        "He showed\r\nthem the sink in the kitchen, with running water and a faucet,\r\nsomething which Teta Elzbieta had never in her wildest dreams hoped to\r\npossess.",
        "After a discovery such as that it would have seemed ungrateful\r\nto find any fault, and so they tried to shut their eyes to other\r\ndefects.",
        "Still, they were peasant people, and they hung on to their money by\r\ninstinct; it was quite in vain that the agent hinted at promptness—they\r\nwould see, they would see, they told him, they could not decide until\r\nthey had had more time.",
        "And so they went home again, and all day and\r\nevening there was figuring and debating.",
        "It was an agony to them to\r\nhave to make up their minds in a matter such as this.",
        "They never could\r\nagree all together; there were so many arguments upon each side, and\r\none would be obstinate, and no sooner would the rest have convinced him\r\nthan it would transpire that his arguments had caused another to waver.",
        "Once, in the evening, when they were all in harmony, and the house was\r\nas good as bought, Szedvilas came in and upset them again.",
        "Szedvilas\r\nhad no use for property owning.",
        "He told them cruel stories of people\r\nwho had been done to death in this “buying a home” swindle.",
        "They would\r\nbe almost sure to get into a tight place and lose all their money; and\r\nthere was no end of expense that one could never foresee; and the house\r\nmight be good-for-nothing from top to bottom—how was a poor man to\r\nknow?",
        "Then, too, they would swindle you with the contract—and how was a\r\npoor man to understand anything about a contract?",
        "It was all nothing\r\nbut robbery, and there was no safety but in keeping out of it.",
        "And pay\r\nrent?",
        "asked Jurgis.",
        "Ah, yes, to be sure, the other answered, that too\r\nwas robbery.",
        "It was all robbery, for a poor man.",
        "After half an hour of\r\nsuch depressing conversation, they had their minds quite made up that\r\nthey had been saved at the brink of a precipice; but then Szedvilas\r\nwent away, and Jonas, who was a sharp little man, reminded them that\r\nthe delicatessen business was a failure, according to its proprietor,\r\nand that this might account for his pessimistic views.",
        "Which, of\r\ncourse, reopened the subject!",
        "The controlling factor was that they could not stay where they\r\nwere—they had to go somewhere.",
        "And when they gave up the house plan and\r\ndecided to rent, the prospect of paying out nine dollars a month\r\nforever they found just as hard to face.",
        "All day and all night for\r\nnearly a whole week they wrestled with the problem, and then in the end\r\nJurgis took the responsibility.",
        "Brother Jonas had gotten his job, and\r\nwas pushing a truck in Durham’s; and the killing gang at Brown’s\r\ncontinued to work early and late, so that Jurgis grew more confident\r\nevery hour, more certain of his mastership.",
        "It was the kind of thing\r\nthe man of the family had to decide and carry through, he told himself.",
        "Others might have failed at it, but he was not the failing kind—he\r\nwould show them how to do it.",
        "He would work all day, and all night,\r\ntoo, if need be; he would never rest until the house was paid for and\r\nhis people had a home.",
        "So he told them, and so in the end the decision\r\nwas made.",
        "They had talked about looking at more houses before they made the\r\npurchase; but then they did not know where any more were, and they did\r\nnot know any way of finding out.",
        "The one they had seen held the sway in\r\ntheir thoughts; whenever they thought of themselves in a house, it was\r\nthis house that they thought of.",
        "And so they went and told the agent\r\nthat they were ready to make the agreement.",
        "They knew, as an abstract\r\nproposition, that in matters of business all men are to be accounted\r\nliars; but they could not but have been influenced by all they had\r\nheard from the eloquent agent, and were quite persuaded that the house\r\nwas something they had run a risk of losing by their delay.",
        "They drew a\r\ndeep breath when he told them that they were still in time.",
        "They were to come on the morrow, and he would have the papers all drawn\r\nup.",
        "This matter of papers was one in which Jurgis understood to the\r\nfull the need of caution; yet he could not go himself—every one told\r\nhim that he could not get a holiday, and that he might lose his job by\r\nasking.",
        "So there was nothing to be done but to trust it to the women,\r\nwith Szedvilas, who promised to go with them.",
        "Jurgis spent a whole\r\nevening impressing upon them the seriousness of the occasion—and then\r\nfinally, out of innumerable hiding places about their persons and in\r\ntheir baggage, came forth the precious wads of money, to be done up\r\ntightly in a little bag and sewed fast in the lining of Teta Elzbieta’s\r\ndress.",
        "Early in the morning they sallied forth.",
        "Jurgis had given them so many\r\ninstructions and warned them against so many perils, that the women\r\nwere quite pale with fright, and even the imperturbable delicatessen\r\nvender, who prided himself upon being a businessman, was ill at ease.",
        "The agent had the deed all ready, and invited them to sit down and read\r\nit; this Szedvilas proceeded to do—a painful and laborious process,\r\nduring which the agent drummed upon the desk.",
        "Teta Elzbieta was so\r\nembarrassed that the perspiration came out upon her forehead in beads;\r\nfor was not this reading as much as to say plainly to the gentleman’s\r\nface that they doubted his honesty?",
        "Yet Jokubas Szedvilas read on and\r\non; and presently there developed that he had good reason for doing so.",
        "For a horrible suspicion had begun dawning in his mind; he knitted his\r\nbrows more and more as he read.",
        "This was not a deed of sale at all, so\r\nfar as he could see—it provided only for the renting of the property!",
        "It was hard to tell, with all this strange legal jargon, words he had\r\nnever heard before; but was not this plain—“the party of the first part\r\nhereby covenants and agrees to rent to the said party of the second\r\npart!” And then again—“a monthly _rental_ of twelve dollars, for a\r\nperiod of eight years and four months!” Then Szedvilas took off his\r\nspectacles, and looked at the agent, and stammered a question.",
        "The agent was most polite, and explained that that was the usual\r\nformula; that it was always arranged that the property should be merely\r\nrented.",
        "He kept trying to show them something in the next paragraph;\r\nbut Szedvilas could not get by the word “rental”—and when he translated\r\nit to Teta Elzbieta, she too was thrown into a fright.",
        "They would not\r\nown the home at all, then, for nearly nine years!",
        "The agent, with\r\ninfinite patience, began to explain again; but no explanation would do\r\nnow.",
        "Elzbieta had firmly fixed in her mind the last solemn warning of\r\nJurgis: “If there is anything wrong, do not give him the money, but go\r\nout and get a lawyer.” It was an agonizing moment, but she sat in the\r\nchair, her hands clenched like death, and made a fearful effort,\r\nsummoning all her powers, and gasped out her purpose.",
        "Jokubas translated her words.",
        "She expected the agent to fly into a\r\npassion, but he was, to her bewilderment, as ever imperturbable; he\r\neven offered to go and get a lawyer for her, but she declined this.",
        "They went a long way, on purpose to find a man who would not be a\r\nconfederate.",
        "Then let any one imagine their dismay, when, after half an\r\nhour, they came in with a lawyer, and heard him greet the agent by his\r\nfirst name!",
        "They felt that all was lost; they sat like prisoners\r\nsummoned to hear the reading of their death warrant.",
        "There was nothing\r\nmore that they could do—they were trapped!",
        "The lawyer read over the\r\ndeed, and when he had read it he informed Szedvilas that it was all\r\nperfectly regular, that the deed was a blank deed such as was often\r\nused in these sales.",
        "And was the price as agreed?",
        "the old man\r\nasked—three hundred dollars down, and the balance at twelve dollars a\r\nmonth, till the total of fifteen hundred dollars had been paid?",
        "Yes,\r\nthat was correct.",
        "And it was for the sale of such and such a house—the\r\nhouse and lot and everything?",
        "Yes,—and the lawyer showed him where that\r\nwas all written.",
        "And it was all perfectly regular—there were no tricks\r\nabout it of any sort?",
        "They were poor people, and this was all they had\r\nin the world, and if there was anything wrong they would be ruined.",
        "And\r\nso Szedvilas went on, asking one trembling question after another,\r\nwhile the eyes of the women folks were fixed upon him in mute agony.",
        "They could not understand what he was saying, but they knew that upon\r\nit their fate depended.",
        "And when at last he had questioned until there\r\nwas no more questioning to be done, and the time came for them to make\r\nup their minds, and either close the bargain or reject it, it was all\r\nthat poor Teta Elzbieta could do to keep from bursting into tears.",
        "Jokubas had asked her if she wished to sign; he had asked her twice—and\r\nwhat could she say?",
        "How did she know if this lawyer were telling the\r\ntruth—that he was not in the conspiracy?",
        "And yet, how could she say\r\nso—what excuse could she give?",
        "The eyes of every one in the room were\r\nupon her, awaiting her decision; and at last, half blind with her\r\ntears, she began fumbling in her jacket, where she had pinned the\r\nprecious money.",
        "And she brought it out and unwrapped it before the men.",
        "All of this Ona sat watching, from a corner of the room, twisting her\r\nhands together, meantime, in a fever of fright.",
        "Ona longed to cry out\r\nand tell her stepmother to stop, that it was all a trap; but there\r\nseemed to be something clutching her by the throat, and she could not\r\nmake a sound.",
        "And so Teta Elzbieta laid the money on the table, and the\r\nagent picked it up and counted it, and then wrote them a receipt for it\r\nand passed them the deed.",
        "Then he gave a sigh of satisfaction, and rose\r\nand shook hands with them all, still as smooth and polite as at the\r\nbeginning.",
        "Ona had a dim recollection of the lawyer telling Szedvilas\r\nthat his charge was a dollar, which occasioned some debate, and more\r\nagony; and then, after they had paid that, too, they went out into the\r\nstreet, her stepmother clutching the deed in her hand.",
        "They were so\r\nweak from fright that they could not walk, but had to sit down on the\r\nway.",
        "So they went home, with a deadly terror gnawing at their souls; and\r\nthat evening Jurgis came home and heard their story, and that was the\r\nend.",
        "Jurgis was sure that they had been swindled, and were ruined; and\r\nhe tore his hair and cursed like a madman, swearing that he would kill\r\nthe agent that very night.",
        "In the end he seized the paper and rushed\r\nout of the house, and all the way across the yards to Halsted Street.",
        "He dragged Szedvilas out from his supper, and together they rushed to\r\nconsult another lawyer.",
        "When they entered his office the lawyer sprang\r\nup, for Jurgis looked like a crazy person, with flying hair and\r\nbloodshot eyes.",
        "His companion explained the situation, and the lawyer\r\ntook the paper and began to read it, while Jurgis stood clutching the\r\ndesk with knotted hands, trembling in every nerve.",
        "Once or twice the lawyer looked up and asked a question of Szedvilas;\r\nthe other did not know a word that he was saying, but his eyes were\r\nfixed upon the lawyer’s face, striving in an agony of dread to read his\r\nmind.",
        "He saw the lawyer look up and laugh, and he gave a gasp; the man\r\nsaid something to Szedvilas, and Jurgis turned upon his friend, his\r\nheart almost stopping.",
        "“Well?” he panted.",
        "“He says it is all right,” said Szedvilas.",
        "“All right!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he says it is just as it should be.” And Jurgis, in his relief,\r\nsank down into a chair.",
        "“Are you sure of it?” he gasped, and made Szedvilas translate question\r\nafter question.",
        "He could not hear it often enough; he could not ask\r\nwith enough variations.",
        "Yes, they had bought the house, they had really\r\nbought it.",
        "It belonged to them, they had only to pay the money and it\r\nwould be all right.",
        "Then Jurgis covered his face with his hands, for\r\nthere were tears in his eyes, and he felt like a fool.",
        "But he had had\r\nsuch a horrible fright; strong man as he was, it left him almost too\r\nweak to stand up.",
        "The lawyer explained that the rental was a form—the property was said\r\nto be merely rented until the last payment had been made, the purpose\r\nbeing to make it easier to turn the party out if he did not make the\r\npayments.",
        "So long as they paid, however, they had nothing to fear, the\r\nhouse was all theirs.",
        "Jurgis was so grateful that he paid the half dollar the lawyer asked\r\nwithout winking an eyelash, and then rushed home to tell the news to\r\nthe family.",
        "He found Ona in a faint and the babies screaming, and the\r\nwhole house in an uproar—for it had been believed by all that he had\r\ngone to murder the agent.",
        "It was hours before the excitement could be\r\ncalmed; and all through that cruel night Jurgis would wake up now and\r\nthen and hear Ona and her stepmother in the next room, sobbing softly\r\nto themselves.",
        "CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had bought their home.",
        "It was hard for them to realize that the\r\nwonderful house was theirs to move into whenever they chose.",
        "They spent\r\nall their time thinking about it, and what they were going to put into\r\nit.",
        "As their week with Aniele was up in three days, they lost no time\r\nin getting ready.",
        "They had to make some shift to furnish it, and every\r\ninstant of their leisure was given to discussing this.",
        "A person who had such a task before him would not need to look very far\r\nin Packingtown—he had only to walk up the avenue and read the signs, or\r\nget into a streetcar, to obtain full information as to pretty much\r\neverything a human creature could need.",
        "It was quite touching, the zeal\r\nof people to see that his health and happiness were provided for.",
        "Did\r\nthe person wish to smoke?",
        "There was a little discourse about cigars,\r\nshowing him exactly why the Thomas Jefferson Five-cent Perfecto was the\r\nonly cigar worthy of the name.",
        "Had he, on the other hand, smoked too\r\nmuch?",
        "Here was a remedy for the smoking habit, twenty-five doses for a\r\nquarter, and a cure absolutely guaranteed in ten doses.",
        "In innumerable\r\nways such as this, the traveler found that somebody had been busied to\r\nmake smooth his paths through the world, and to let him know what had\r\nbeen done for him.",
        "In Packingtown the advertisements had a style all of\r\ntheir own, adapted to the peculiar population.",
        "One would be tenderly\r\nsolicitous.",
        "“Is your wife pale?” it would inquire.",
        "“Is she discouraged,\r\ndoes she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?",
        "Why do you not tell her to try Dr.",
        "Lanahan’s Life Preservers?” Another\r\nwould be jocular in tone, slapping you on the back, so to speak.",
        "“Don’t\r\nbe a chump!” it would exclaim.",
        "“Go and get the Goliath Bunion Cure.”\r\n“Get a move on you!” would chime in another.",
        "“It’s easy, if you wear\r\nthe Eureka Two-fifty Shoe.”\r\n\r\nAmong these importunate signs was one that had caught the attention of\r\nthe family by its pictures.",
        "It showed two very pretty little birds\r\nbuilding themselves a home; and Marija had asked an acquaintance to\r\nread it to her, and told them that it related to the furnishing of a\r\nhouse.",
        "“Feather your nest,” it ran—and went on to say that it could\r\nfurnish all the necessary feathers for a four-room nest for the\r\nludicrously small sum of seventy-five dollars.",
        "The particularly\r\nimportant thing about this offer was that only a small part of the\r\nmoney need be had at once—the rest one might pay a few dollars every\r\nmonth.",
        "Our friends had to have some furniture, there was no getting\r\naway from that; but their little fund of money had sunk so low that\r\nthey could hardly get to sleep at night, and so they fled to this as\r\ntheir deliverance.",
        "There was more agony and another paper for Elzbieta\r\nto sign, and then one night when Jurgis came home, he was told the\r\nbreathless tidings that the furniture had arrived and was safely stowed\r\nin the house: a parlor set of four pieces, a bedroom set of three\r\npieces, a dining room table and four chairs, a toilet set with\r\nbeautiful pink roses painted all over it, an assortment of crockery,\r\nalso with pink roses—and so on.",
        "One of the plates in the set had been\r\nfound broken when they unpacked it, and Ona was going to the store the\r\nfirst thing in the morning to make them change it; also they had\r\npromised three saucepans, and there had only two come, and did Jurgis\r\nthink that they were trying to cheat them?",
        "The next day they went to the house; and when the men came from work\r\nthey ate a few hurried mouthfuls at Aniele’s, and then set to work at\r\nthe task of carrying their belongings to their new home.",
        "The distance\r\nwas in reality over two miles, but Jurgis made two trips that night,\r\neach time with a huge pile of mattresses and bedding on his head, with\r\nbundles of clothing and bags and things tied up inside.",
        "Anywhere else\r\nin Chicago he would have stood a good chance of being arrested; but the\r\npolicemen in Packingtown were apparently used to these informal\r\nmovings, and contented themselves with a cursory examination now and\r\nthen.",
        "It was quite wonderful to see how fine the house looked, with all\r\nthe things in it, even by the dim light of a lamp: it was really home,\r\nand almost as exciting as the placard had described it.",
        "Ona was fairly\r\ndancing, and she and Cousin Marija took Jurgis by the arm and escorted\r\nhim from room to room, sitting in each chair by turns, and then\r\ninsisting that he should do the same.",
        "One chair squeaked with his great\r\nweight, and they screamed with fright, and woke the baby and brought\r\neverybody running.",
        "Altogether it was a great day; and tired as they\r\nwere, Jurgis and Ona sat up late, contented simply to hold each other\r\nand gaze in rapture about the room.",
        "They were going to be married as\r\nsoon as they could get everything settled, and a little spare money put\r\nby; and this was to be their home—that little room yonder would be\r\ntheirs!",
        "It was in truth a never-ending delight, the fixing up of this house.",
        "They had no money to spend for the pleasure of spending, but there were\r\na few absolutely necessary things, and the buying of these was a\r\nperpetual adventure for Ona.",
        "It must always be done at night, so that\r\nJurgis could go along; and even if it were only a pepper cruet, or half\r\na dozen glasses for ten cents, that was enough for an expedition.",
        "On\r\nSaturday night they came home with a great basketful of things, and\r\nspread them out on the table, while every one stood round, and the\r\nchildren climbed up on the chairs, or howled to be lifted up to see.",
        "There were sugar and salt and tea and crackers, and a can of lard and a\r\nmilk pail, and a scrubbing brush, and a pair of shoes for the second\r\noldest boy, and a can of oil, and a tack hammer, and a pound of nails.",
        "These last were to be driven into the walls of the kitchen and the\r\nbedrooms, to hang things on; and there was a family discussion as to\r\nthe place where each one was to be driven.",
        "Then Jurgis would try to\r\nhammer, and hit his fingers because the hammer was too small, and get\r\nmad because Ona had refused to let him pay fifteen cents more and get a\r\nbigger hammer; and Ona would be invited to try it herself, and hurt her\r\nthumb, and cry out, which necessitated the thumb’s being kissed by\r\nJurgis.",
        "Finally, after every one had had a try, the nails would be\r\ndriven, and something hung up.",
        "Jurgis had come home with a big packing\r\nbox on his head, and he sent Jonas to get another that he had bought.",
        "He meant to take one side out of these tomorrow, and put shelves in\r\nthem, and make them into bureaus and places to keep things for the\r\nbedrooms.",
        "The nest which had been advertised had not included feathers\r\nfor quite so many birds as there were in this family.",
        "They had, of course, put their dining table in the kitchen, and the\r\ndining room was used as the bedroom of Teta Elzbieta and five of her\r\nchildren.",
        "She and the two youngest slept in the only bed, and the other\r\nthree had a mattress on the floor.",
        "Ona and her cousin dragged a\r\nmattress into the parlor and slept at night, and the three men and the\r\noldest boy slept in the other room, having nothing but the very level\r\nfloor to rest on for the present.",
        "Even so, however, they slept\r\nsoundly—it was necessary for Teta Elzbieta to pound more than once on\r\nthe door at a quarter past five every morning.",
        "She would have ready a\r\ngreat pot full of steaming black coffee, and oatmeal and bread and\r\nsmoked sausages; and then she would fix them their dinner pails with\r\nmore thick slices of bread with lard between them—they could not afford\r\nbutter—and some onions and a piece of cheese, and so they would tramp\r\naway to work.",
        "This was the first time in his life that he had ever really worked, it\r\nseemed to Jurgis; it was the first time that he had ever had anything\r\nto do which took all he had in him.",
        "Jurgis had stood with the rest up\r\nin the gallery and watched the men on the killing beds, marveling at\r\ntheir speed and power as if they had been wonderful machines; it\r\nsomehow never occurred to one to think of the flesh-and-blood side of\r\nit—that is, not until he actually got down into the pit and took off\r\nhis coat.",
        "Then he saw things in a different light, he got at the inside\r\nof them.",
        "The pace they set here, it was one that called for every\r\nfaculty of a man—from the instant the first steer fell till the\r\nsounding of the noon whistle, and again from half-past twelve till\r\nheaven only knew what hour in the late afternoon or evening, there was\r\nnever one instant’s rest for a man, for his hand or his eye or his\r\nbrain.",
        "Jurgis saw how they managed it; there were portions of the work\r\nwhich determined the pace of the rest, and for these they had picked\r\nmen whom they paid high wages, and whom they changed frequently.",
        "You\r\nmight easily pick out these pacemakers, for they worked under the eye\r\nof the bosses, and they worked like men possessed.",
        "This was called\r\n“speeding up the gang,” and if any man could not keep up with the pace,\r\nthere were hundreds outside begging to try.",
        "Yet Jurgis did not mind it; he rather enjoyed it.",
        "It saved him the\r\nnecessity of flinging his arms about and fidgeting as he did in most\r\nwork.",
        "He would laugh to himself as he ran down the line, darting a\r\nglance now and then at the man ahead of him.",
        "It was not the pleasantest\r\nwork one could think of, but it was necessary work; and what more had a\r\nman the right to ask than a chance to do something useful, and to get\r\ngood pay for doing it?",
        "So Jurgis thought, and so he spoke, in his bold, free way; very much to\r\nhis surprise, he found that it had a tendency to get him into trouble.",
        "For most of the men here took a fearfully different view of the thing.",
        "He was quite dismayed when he first began to find it out—that most of\r\nthe men _hated_ their work.",
        "It seemed strange, it was even terrible,\r\nwhen you came to find out the universality of the sentiment; but it was\r\ncertainly the fact—they hated their work.",
        "They hated the bosses and\r\nthey hated the owners; they hated the whole place, the whole\r\nneighborhood—even the whole city, with an all-inclusive hatred, bitter\r\nand fierce.",
        "Women and little children would fall to cursing about it;\r\nit was rotten, rotten as hell—everything was rotten.",
        "When Jurgis would\r\nask them what they meant, they would begin to get suspicious, and\r\ncontent themselves with saying, “Never mind, you stay here and see for\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\nOne of the first problems that Jurgis ran upon was that of the unions.",
        "He had had no experience with unions, and he had to have it explained\r\nto him that the men were banded together for the purpose of fighting\r\nfor their rights.",
        "Jurgis asked them what they meant by their rights, a\r\nquestion in which he was quite sincere, for he had not any idea of any\r\nrights that he had, except the right to hunt for a job, and do as he\r\nwas told when he got it.",
        "Generally, however, this harmless question\r\nwould only make his fellow workingmen lose their tempers and call him a\r\nfool.",
        "There was a delegate of the butcher-helpers’ union who came to\r\nsee Jurgis to enroll him; and when Jurgis found that this meant that he\r\nwould have to part with some of his money, he froze up directly, and\r\nthe delegate, who was an Irishman and only knew a few words of\r\nLithuanian, lost his temper and began to threaten him.",
        "In the end\r\nJurgis got into a fine rage, and made it sufficiently plain that it\r\nwould take more than one Irishman to scare him into a union.",
        "Little by\r\nlittle he gathered that the main thing the men wanted was to put a stop\r\nto the habit of “speeding-up”; they were trying their best to force a\r\nlessening of the pace, for there were some, they said, who could not\r\nkeep up with it, whom it was killing.",
        "But Jurgis had no sympathy with\r\nsuch ideas as this—he could do the work himself, and so could the rest\r\nof them, he declared, if they were good for anything.",
        "If they couldn’t\r\ndo it, let them go somewhere else.",
        "Jurgis had not studied the books,\r\nand he would not have known how to pronounce “laissez faire”; but he\r\nhad been round the world enough to know that a man has to shift for\r\nhimself in it, and that if he gets the worst of it, there is nobody to\r\nlisten to him holler.",
        "Yet there have been known to be philosophers and plain men who swore by\r\nMalthus in the books, and would, nevertheless, subscribe to a relief\r\nfund in time of a famine.",
        "It was the same with Jurgis, who consigned\r\nthe unfit to destruction, while going about all day sick at heart\r\nbecause of his poor old father, who was wandering somewhere in the\r\nyards begging for a chance to earn his bread.",
        "Old Antanas had been a\r\nworker ever since he was a child; he had run away from home when he was\r\ntwelve, because his father beat him for trying to learn to read.",
        "And he\r\nwas a faithful man, too; he was a man you might leave alone for a\r\nmonth, if only you had made him understand what you wanted him to do in\r\nthe meantime.",
        "And now here he was, worn out in soul and body, and with\r\nno more place in the world than a sick dog.",
        "He had his home, as it\r\nhappened, and some one who would care for him if he never got a job;\r\nbut his son could not help thinking, suppose this had not been the\r\ncase.",
        "Antanas Rudkus had been into every building in Packingtown by\r\nthis time, and into nearly every room; he had stood mornings among the\r\ncrowd of applicants till the very policemen had come to know his face\r\nand to tell him to go home and give it up.",
        "He had been likewise to all\r\nthe stores and saloons for a mile about, begging for some little thing\r\nto do; and everywhere they had ordered him out, sometimes with curses,\r\nand not once even stopping to ask him a question.",
        "So, after all, there was a crack in the fine structure of Jurgis’ faith\r\nin things as they are.",
        "The crack was wide while Dede Antanas was\r\nhunting a job—and it was yet wider when he finally got it.",
        "For one\r\nevening the old man came home in a great state of excitement, with the\r\ntale that he had been approached by a man in one of the corridors of\r\nthe pickle rooms of Durham’s, and asked what he would pay to get a job.",
        "He had not known what to make of this at first; but the man had gone on\r\nwith matter-of-fact frankness to say that he could get him a job,\r\nprovided that he were willing to pay one-third of his wages for it.",
        "Was\r\nhe a boss?",
        "Antanas had asked; to which the man had replied that that\r\nwas nobody’s business, but that he could do what he said.",
        "Jurgis had made some friends by this time, and he sought one of them\r\nand asked what this meant.",
        "The friend, who was named Tamoszius\r\nKuszleika, was a sharp little man who folded hides on the killing beds,\r\nand he listened to what Jurgis had to say without seeming at all\r\nsurprised.",
        "They were common enough, he said, such cases of petty graft.",
        "It was simply some boss who proposed to add a little to his income.",
        "After Jurgis had been there awhile he would know that the plants were\r\nsimply honeycombed with rottenness of that sort—the bosses grafted off\r\nthe men, and they grafted off each other; and some day the\r\nsuperintendent would find out about the boss, and then he would graft\r\noff the boss.",
        "Warming to the subject, Tamoszius went on to explain the\r\nsituation.",
        "Here was Durham’s, for instance, owned by a man who was\r\ntrying to make as much money out of it as he could, and did not care in\r\nthe least how he did it; and underneath him, ranged in ranks and grades\r\nlike an army, were managers and superintendents and foremen, each one\r\ndriving the man next below him and trying to squeeze out of him as much\r\nwork as possible.",
        "And all the men of the same rank were pitted against\r\neach other; the accounts of each were kept separately, and every man\r\nlived in terror of losing his job, if another made a better record than\r\nhe.",
        "So from top to bottom the place was simply a seething caldron of\r\njealousies and hatreds; there was no loyalty or decency anywhere about\r\nit, there was no place in it where a man counted for anything against a\r\ndollar.",
        "And worse than there being no decency, there was not even any\r\nhonesty.",
        "The reason for that?",
        "Who could say?",
        "It must have been old\r\nDurham in the beginning; it was a heritage which the self-made merchant\r\nhad left to his son, along with his millions.",
        "Jurgis would find out these things for himself, if he stayed there long\r\nenough; it was the men who had to do all the dirty jobs, and so there\r\nwas no deceiving them; and they caught the spirit of the place, and did\r\nlike all the rest.",
        "Jurgis had come there, and thought he was going to\r\nmake himself useful, and rise and become a skilled man; but he would\r\nsoon find out his error—for nobody rose in Packingtown by doing good\r\nwork.",
        "You could lay that down for a rule—if you met a man who was\r\nrising in Packingtown, you met a knave.",
        "That man who had been sent to\r\nJurgis’ father by the boss, _he_ would rise; the man who told tales and\r\nspied upon his fellows would rise; but the man who minded his own\r\nbusiness and did his work—why, they would “speed him up” till they had\r\nworn him out, and then they would throw him into the gutter.",
        "Jurgis went home with his head buzzing.",
        "Yet he could not bring himself\r\nto believe such things—no, it could not be so.",
        "Tamoszius was simply\r\nanother of the grumblers.",
        "He was a man who spent all his time fiddling;\r\nand he would go to parties at night and not get home till sunrise, and\r\nso of course he did not feel like work.",
        "Then, too, he was a puny little\r\nchap; and so he had been left behind in the race, and that was why he\r\nwas sore.",
        "And yet so many strange things kept coming to Jurgis’ notice\r\nevery day!",
        "He tried to persuade his father to have nothing to do with the offer.",
        "But old Antanas had begged until he was worn out, and all his courage\r\nwas gone; he wanted a job, any sort of a job.",
        "So the next day he went\r\nand found the man who had spoken to him, and promised to bring him a\r\nthird of all he earned; and that same day he was put to work in\r\nDurham’s cellars.",
        "It was a “pickle room,” where there was never a dry\r\nspot to stand upon, and so he had to take nearly the whole of his first\r\nweek’s earnings to buy him a pair of heavy-soled boots.",
        "He was a\r\n“squeedgie” man; his job was to go about all day with a long-handled\r\nmop, swabbing up the floor.",
        "Except that it was damp and dark, it was\r\nnot an unpleasant job, in summer.",
        "Now Antanas Rudkus was the meekest man that God ever put on earth; and\r\nso Jurgis found it a striking confirmation of what the men all said,\r\nthat his father had been at work only two days before he came home as\r\nbitter as any of them, and cursing Durham’s with all the power of his\r\nsoul.",
        "For they had set him to cleaning out the traps; and the family\r\nsat round and listened in wonder while he told them what that meant.",
        "It\r\nseemed that he was working in the room where the men prepared the beef\r\nfor canning, and the beef had lain in vats full of chemicals, and men\r\nwith great forks speared it out and dumped it into trucks, to be taken\r\nto the cooking room.",
        "When they had speared out all they could reach,\r\nthey emptied the vat on the floor, and then with shovels scraped up the\r\nbalance and dumped it into the truck.",
        "This floor was filthy, yet they\r\nset Antanas with his mop slopping the “pickle” into a hole that\r\nconnected with a sink, where it was caught and used over again forever;\r\nand if that were not enough, there was a trap in the pipe, where all\r\nthe scraps of meat and odds and ends of refuse were caught, and every\r\nfew days it was the old man’s task to clean these out, and shovel their\r\ncontents into one of the trucks with the rest of the meat!",
        "This was the experience of Antanas; and then there came also Jonas and\r\nMarija with tales to tell.",
        "Marija was working for one of the\r\nindependent packers, and was quite beside herself and outrageous with\r\ntriumph over the sums of money she was making as a painter of cans.",
        "But\r\none day she walked home with a pale-faced little woman who worked\r\nopposite to her, Jadvyga Marcinkus by name, and Jadvyga told her how\r\nshe, Marija, had chanced to get her job.",
        "She had taken the place of an\r\nIrishwoman who had been working in that factory ever since any one\r\ncould remember.",
        "For over fifteen years, so she declared.",
        "Mary Dennis\r\nwas her name, and a long time ago she had been seduced, and had a\r\nlittle boy; he was a cripple, and an epileptic, but still he was all\r\nthat she had in the world to love, and they had lived in a little room\r\nalone somewhere back of Halsted Street, where the Irish were.",
        "Mary had\r\nhad consumption, and all day long you might hear her coughing as she\r\nworked; of late she had been going all to pieces, and when Marija came,\r\nthe “forelady” had suddenly decided to turn her off.",
        "The forelady had\r\nto come up to a certain standard herself, and could not stop for sick\r\npeople, Jadvyga explained.",
        "The fact that Mary had been there so long\r\nhad not made any difference to her—it was doubtful if she even knew\r\nthat, for both the forelady and the superintendent were new people,\r\nhaving only been there two or three years themselves.",
        "Jadvyga did not\r\nknow what had become of the poor creature; she would have gone to see\r\nher, but had been sick herself.",
        "She had pains in her back all the time,\r\nJadvyga explained, and feared that she had womb trouble.",
        "It was not fit\r\nwork for a woman, handling fourteen-pound cans all day.",
        "It was a striking circumstance that Jonas, too, had gotten his job by\r\nthe misfortune of some other person.",
        "Jonas pushed a truck loaded with\r\nhams from the smoke rooms on to an elevator, and thence to the packing\r\nrooms.",
        "The trucks were all of iron, and heavy, and they put about\r\nthreescore hams on each of them, a load of more than a quarter of a\r\nton.",
        "On the uneven floor it was a task for a man to start one of these\r\ntrucks, unless he was a giant; and when it was once started he\r\nnaturally tried his best to keep it going.",
        "There was always the boss\r\nprowling about, and if there was a second’s delay he would fall to\r\ncursing; Lithuanians and Slovaks and such, who could not understand\r\nwhat was said to them, the bosses were wont to kick about the place\r\nlike so many dogs.",
        "Therefore these trucks went for the most part on the\r\nrun; and the predecessor of Jonas had been jammed against the wall by\r\none and crushed in a horrible and nameless manner.",
        "All of these were sinister incidents; but they were trifles compared to\r\nwhat Jurgis saw with his own eyes before long.",
        "One curious thing he had\r\nnoticed, the very first day, in his profession of shoveler of guts;\r\nwhich was the sharp trick of the floor bosses whenever there chanced to\r\ncome a “slunk” calf.",
        "Any man who knows anything about butchering knows\r\nthat the flesh of a cow that is about to calve, or has just calved, is\r\nnot fit for food.",
        "A good many of these came every day to the packing\r\nhouses—and, of course, if they had chosen, it would have been an easy\r\nmatter for the packers to keep them till they were fit for food.",
        "But\r\nfor the saving of time and fodder, it was the law that cows of that\r\nsort came along with the others, and whoever noticed it would tell the\r\nboss, and the boss would start up a conversation with the government\r\ninspector, and the two would stroll away.",
        "So in a trice the carcass of\r\nthe cow would be cleaned out, and entrails would have vanished; it was\r\nJurgis’ task to slide them into the trap, calves and all, and on the\r\nfloor below they took out these “slunk” calves, and butchered them for\r\nmeat, and used even the skins of them.",
        "One day a man slipped and hurt his leg; and that afternoon, when the\r\nlast of the cattle had been disposed of, and the men were leaving,\r\nJurgis was ordered to remain and do some special work which this\r\ninjured man had usually done.",
        "It was late, almost dark, and the\r\ngovernment inspectors had all gone, and there were only a dozen or two\r\nof men on the floor.",
        "That day they had killed about four thousand\r\ncattle, and these cattle had come in freight trains from far states,\r\nand some of them had got hurt.",
        "There were some with broken legs, and\r\nsome with gored sides; there were some that had died, from what cause\r\nno one could say; and they were all to be disposed of, here in darkness\r\nand silence.",
        "“Downers,” the men called them; and the packing house had\r\na special elevator upon which they were raised to the killing beds,\r\nwhere the gang proceeded to handle them, with an air of businesslike\r\nnonchalance which said plainer than any words that it was a matter of\r\neveryday routine.",
        "It took a couple of hours to get them out of the way,\r\nand in the end Jurgis saw them go into the chilling rooms with the rest\r\nof the meat, being carefully scattered here and there so that they\r\ncould not be identified.",
        "When he came home that night he was in a very\r\nsomber mood, having begun to see at last how those might be right who\r\nhad laughed at him for his faith in America.",
        "CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis and Ona were very much in love; they had waited a long time—it\r\nwas now well into the second year, and Jurgis judged everything by the\r\ncriterion of its helping or hindering their union.",
        "All his thoughts\r\nwere there; he accepted the family because it was a part of Ona.",
        "And he\r\nwas interested in the house because it was to be Ona’s home.",
        "Even the\r\ntricks and cruelties he saw at Durham’s had little meaning for him just\r\nthen, save as they might happen to affect his future with Ona.",
        "The marriage would have been at once, if they had had their way; but\r\nthis would mean that they would have to do without any wedding feast,\r\nand when they suggested this they came into conflict with the old\r\npeople.",
        "To Teta Elzbieta especially the very suggestion was an\r\naffliction.",
        "What!",
        "she would cry.",
        "To be married on the roadside like a\r\nparcel of beggars!",
        "No!",
        "No!—Elzbieta had some traditions behind her; she\r\nhad been a person of importance in her girlhood—had lived on a big\r\nestate and had servants, and might have married well and been a lady,\r\nbut for the fact that there had been nine daughters and no sons in the\r\nfamily.",
        "Even so, however, she knew what was decent, and clung to her\r\ntraditions with desperation.",
        "They were not going to lose all caste,\r\neven if they had come to be unskilled laborers in Packingtown; and that\r\nOna had even talked of omitting a _veselija_ was enough to keep her\r\nstepmother lying awake all night.",
        "It was in vain for them to say that\r\nthey had so few friends; they were bound to have friends in time, and\r\nthen the friends would talk about it.",
        "They must not give up what was\r\nright for a little money—if they did, the money would never do them any\r\ngood, they could depend upon that.",
        "And Elzbieta would call upon Dede\r\nAntanas to support her; there was a fear in the souls of these two,\r\nlest this journey to a new country might somehow undermine the old home\r\nvirtues of their children.",
        "The very first Sunday they had all been\r\ntaken to mass; and poor as they were, Elzbieta had felt it advisable to\r\ninvest a little of her resources in a representation of the babe of\r\nBethlehem, made in plaster, and painted in brilliant colors.",
        "Though it\r\nwas only a foot high, there was a shrine with four snow-white steeples,\r\nand the Virgin standing with her child in her arms, and the kings and\r\nshepherds and wise men bowing down before him.",
        "It had cost fifty cents;\r\nbut Elzbieta had a feeling that money spent for such things was not to\r\nbe counted too closely, it would come back in hidden ways.",
        "The piece\r\nwas beautiful on the parlor mantel, and one could not have a home\r\nwithout some sort of ornament.",
        "The cost of the wedding feast would, of course, be returned to them;\r\nbut the problem was to raise it even temporarily.",
        "They had been in the\r\nneighborhood so short a time that they could not get much credit, and\r\nthere was no one except Szedvilas from whom they could borrow even a\r\nlittle.",
        "Evening after evening Jurgis and Ona would sit and figure the\r\nexpenses, calculating the term of their separation.",
        "They could not\r\npossibly manage it decently for less than two hundred dollars, and even\r\nthough they were welcome to count in the whole of the earnings of\r\nMarija and Jonas, as a loan, they could not hope to raise this sum in\r\nless than four or five months.",
        "So Ona began thinking of seeking\r\nemployment herself, saying that if she had even ordinarily good luck,\r\nshe might be able to take two months off the time.",
        "They were just\r\nbeginning to adjust themselves to this necessity, when out of the clear\r\nsky there fell a thunderbolt upon them—a calamity that scattered all\r\ntheir hopes to the four winds.",
        "About a block away from them there lived another Lithuanian family,\r\nconsisting of an elderly widow and one grown son; their name was\r\nMajauszkis, and our friends struck up an acquaintance with them before\r\nlong.",
        "One evening they came over for a visit, and naturally the first\r\nsubject upon which the conversation turned was the neighborhood and its\r\nhistory; and then Grandmother Majauszkiene, as the old lady was called,\r\nproceeded to recite to them a string of horrors that fairly froze their\r\nblood.",
        "She was a wrinkled-up and wizened personage—she must have been\r\neighty—and as she mumbled the grim story through her toothless gums,\r\nshe seemed a very old witch to them.",
        "Grandmother Majauszkiene had lived\r\nin the midst of misfortune so long that it had come to be her element,\r\nand she talked about starvation, sickness, and death as other people\r\nmight about weddings and holidays.",
        "The thing came gradually.",
        "In the first place as to the house they had\r\nbought, it was not new at all, as they had supposed; it was about\r\nfifteen years old, and there was nothing new upon it but the paint,\r\nwhich was so bad that it needed to be put on new every year or two.",
        "The\r\nhouse was one of a whole row that was built by a company which existed\r\nto make money by swindling poor people.",
        "The family had paid fifteen\r\nhundred dollars for it, and it had not cost the builders five hundred,\r\nwhen it was new.",
        "Grandmother Majauszkiene knew that because her son\r\nbelonged to a political organization with a contractor who put up\r\nexactly such houses.",
        "They used the very flimsiest and cheapest\r\nmaterial; they built the houses a dozen at a time, and they cared about\r\nnothing at all except the outside shine.",
        "The family could take her word\r\nas to the trouble they would have, for she had been through it all—she\r\nand her son had bought their house in exactly the same way.",
        "They had\r\nfooled the company, however, for her son was a skilled man, who made as\r\nhigh as a hundred dollars a month, and as he had had sense enough not\r\nto marry, they had been able to pay for the house.",
        "Grandmother Majauszkiene saw that her friends were puzzled at this\r\nremark; they did not quite see how paying for the house was “fooling\r\nthe company.” Evidently they were very inexperienced.",
        "Cheap as the\r\nhouses were, they were sold with the idea that the people who bought\r\nthem would not be able to pay for them.",
        "When they failed—if it were\r\nonly by a single month—they would lose the house and all that they had\r\npaid on it, and then the company would sell it over again.",
        "And did they\r\noften get a chance to do that?",
        "_Dieve!_ (Grandmother Majauszkiene\r\nraised her hands.) They did it—how often no one could say, but\r\ncertainly more than half of the time.",
        "They might ask any one who knew\r\nanything at all about Packingtown as to that; she had been living here\r\never since this house was built, and she could tell them all about it.",
        "And had it ever been sold before?",
        "_Susimilkie!_ Why, since it had been\r\nbuilt, no less than four families that their informant could name had\r\ntried to buy it and failed.",
        "She would tell them a little about it.",
        "The first family had been Germans.",
        "The families had all been of\r\ndifferent nationalities—there had been a representative of several\r\nraces that had displaced each other in the stockyards.",
        "Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene had come to America with her son at a time when so far as\r\nshe knew there was only one other Lithuanian family in the district;\r\nthe workers had all been Germans then—skilled cattle butchers that the\r\npackers had brought from abroad to start the business.",
        "Afterward, as\r\ncheaper labor had come, these Germans had moved away.",
        "The next were the\r\nIrish—there had been six or eight years when Packingtown had been a\r\nregular Irish city.",
        "There were a few colonies of them still here,\r\nenough to run all the unions and the police force and get all the\r\ngraft; but most of those who were working in the packing houses had\r\ngone away at the next drop in wages—after the big strike.",
        "The Bohemians\r\nhad come then, and after them the Poles.",
        "People said that old man\r\nDurham himself was responsible for these immigrations; he had sworn\r\nthat he would fix the people of Packingtown so that they would never\r\nagain call a strike on him, and so he had sent his agents into every\r\ncity and village in Europe to spread the tale of the chances of work\r\nand high wages at the stockyards.",
        "The people had come in hordes; and\r\nold Durham had squeezed them tighter and tighter, speeding them up and\r\ngrinding them to pieces and sending for new ones.",
        "The Poles, who had\r\ncome by tens of thousands, had been driven to the wall by the\r\nLithuanians, and now the Lithuanians were giving way to the Slovaks.",
        "Who there was poorer and more miserable than the Slovaks, Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene had no idea, but the packers would find them, never fear.",
        "It was easy to bring them, for wages were really much higher, and it\r\nwas only when it was too late that the poor people found out that\r\neverything else was higher too.",
        "They were like rats in a trap, that was\r\nthe truth; and more of them were piling in every day.",
        "By and by they\r\nwould have their revenge, though, for the thing was getting beyond\r\nhuman endurance, and the people would rise and murder the packers.",
        "Grandmother Majauszkiene was a socialist, or some such strange thing;\r\nanother son of hers was working in the mines of Siberia, and the old\r\nlady herself had made speeches in her time—which made her seem all the\r\nmore terrible to her present auditors.",
        "They called her back to the story of the house.",
        "The German family had\r\nbeen a good sort.",
        "To be sure there had been a great many of them, which\r\nwas a common failing in Packingtown; but they had worked hard, and the\r\nfather had been a steady man, and they had a good deal more than half\r\npaid for the house.",
        "But he had been killed in an elevator accident in\r\nDurham’s.",
        "Then there had come the Irish, and there had been lots of them, too;\r\nthe husband drank and beat the children—the neighbors could hear them\r\nshrieking any night.",
        "They were behind with their rent all the time, but\r\nthe company was good to them; there was some politics back of that,\r\nGrandmother Majauszkiene could not say just what, but the Laffertys had\r\nbelonged to the “War Whoop League,” which was a sort of political club\r\nof all the thugs and rowdies in the district; and if you belonged to\r\nthat, you could never be arrested for anything.",
        "Once upon a time old\r\nLafferty had been caught with a gang that had stolen cows from several\r\nof the poor people of the neighborhood and butchered them in an old\r\nshanty back of the yards and sold them.",
        "He had been in jail only three\r\ndays for it, and had come out laughing, and had not even lost his place\r\nin the packing house.",
        "He had gone all to ruin with the drink, however,\r\nand lost his power; one of his sons, who was a good man, had kept him\r\nand the family up for a year or two, but then he had got sick with\r\nconsumption.",
        "That was another thing, Grandmother Majauszkiene interrupted\r\nherself—this house was unlucky.",
        "Every family that lived in it, some one\r\nwas sure to get consumption.",
        "Nobody could tell why that was; there must\r\nbe something about the house, or the way it was built—some folks said\r\nit was because the building had been begun in the dark of the moon.",
        "There were dozens of houses that way in Packingtown.",
        "Sometimes there\r\nwould be a particular room that you could point out—if anybody slept in\r\nthat room he was just as good as dead.",
        "With this house it had been the\r\nIrish first; and then a Bohemian family had lost a child of it—though,\r\nto be sure, that was uncertain, since it was hard to tell what was the\r\nmatter with children who worked in the yards.",
        "In those days there had\r\nbeen no law about the age of children—the packers had worked all but\r\nthe babies.",
        "At this remark the family looked puzzled, and Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene again had to make an explanation—that it was against the\r\nlaw for children to work before they were sixteen.",
        "What was the sense\r\nof that?",
        "they asked.",
        "They had been thinking of letting little\r\nStanislovas go to work.",
        "Well, there was no need to worry, Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene said—the law made no difference except that it forced\r\npeople to lie about the ages of their children.",
        "One would like to know\r\nwhat the lawmakers expected them to do; there were families that had no\r\npossible means of support except the children, and the law provided\r\nthem no other way of getting a living.",
        "Very often a man could get no\r\nwork in Packingtown for months, while a child could go and get a place\r\neasily; there was always some new machine, by which the packers could\r\nget as much work out of a child as they had been able to get out of a\r\nman, and for a third of the pay.",
        "To come back to the house again, it was the woman of the next family\r\nthat had died.",
        "That was after they had been there nearly four years,\r\nand this woman had had twins regularly every year—and there had been\r\nmore than you could count when they moved in.",
        "After she died the man\r\nwould go to work all day and leave them to shift for themselves—the\r\nneighbors would help them now and then, for they would almost freeze to\r\ndeath.",
        "At the end there were three days that they were alone, before it\r\nwas found out that the father was dead.",
        "He was a “floorsman” at\r\nJones’s, and a wounded steer had broken loose and mashed him against a\r\npillar.",
        "Then the children had been taken away, and the company had sold\r\nthe house that very same week to a party of emigrants.",
        "So this grim old woman went on with her tale of horrors.",
        "How much of it\r\nwas exaggeration—who could tell?",
        "It was only too plausible.",
        "There was\r\nthat about consumption, for instance.",
        "They knew nothing about\r\nconsumption whatever, except that it made people cough; and for two\r\nweeks they had been worrying about a coughing-spell of Antanas.",
        "It\r\nseemed to shake him all over, and it never stopped; you could see a red\r\nstain wherever he had spit upon the floor.",
        "And yet all these things were as nothing to what came a little later.",
        "They had begun to question the old lady as to why one family had been\r\nunable to pay, trying to show her by figures that it ought to have been\r\npossible; and Grandmother Majauszkiene had disputed their figures—“You\r\nsay twelve dollars a month; but that does not include the interest.”\r\n\r\nThen they stared at her.",
        "“Interest!” they cried.",
        "“Interest on the money you still owe,” she answered.",
        "“But we don’t have to pay any interest!” they exclaimed, three or four\r\nat once.",
        "“We only have to pay twelve dollars each month.”\r\n\r\nAnd for this she laughed at them.",
        "“You are like all the rest,” she\r\nsaid; “they trick you and eat you alive.",
        "They never sell the houses\r\nwithout interest.",
        "Get your deed, and see.”\r\n\r\nThen, with a horrible sinking of the heart, Teta Elzbieta unlocked her\r\nbureau and brought out the paper that had already caused them so many\r\nagonies.",
        "Now they sat round, scarcely breathing, while the old lady,\r\nwho could read English, ran over it.",
        "“Yes,” she said, finally, “here it\r\nis, of course: ‘With interest thereon monthly, at the rate of seven per\r\ncent per annum.’”\r\n\r\nAnd there followed a dead silence.",
        "“What does that mean?” asked Jurgis\r\nfinally, almost in a whisper.",
        "“That means,” replied the other, “that you have to pay them seven\r\ndollars next month, as well as the twelve dollars.”\r\n\r\nThen again there was not a sound.",
        "It was sickening, like a nightmare,\r\nin which suddenly something gives way beneath you, and you feel\r\nyourself sinking, sinking, down into bottomless abysses.",
        "As if in a\r\nflash of lightning they saw themselves—victims of a relentless fate,\r\ncornered, trapped, in the grip of destruction.",
        "All the fair structure\r\nof their hopes came crashing about their ears.—And all the time the old\r\nwoman was going on talking.",
        "They wished that she would be still; her\r\nvoice sounded like the croaking of some dismal raven.",
        "Jurgis sat with\r\nhis hands clenched and beads of perspiration on his forehead, and there\r\nwas a great lump in Ona’s throat, choking her.",
        "Then suddenly Teta\r\nElzbieta broke the silence with a wail, and Marija began to wring her\r\nhands and sob, “_Ai!",
        "Ai!",
        "Beda man!_”\r\n\r\nAll their outcry did them no good, of course.",
        "There sat Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene, unrelenting, typifying fate.",
        "No, of course it was not\r\nfair, but then fairness had nothing to do with it.",
        "And of course they\r\nhad not known it.",
        "They had not been intended to know it.",
        "But it was in\r\nthe deed, and that was all that was necessary, as they would find when\r\nthe time came.",
        "Somehow or other they got rid of their guest, and then they passed a\r\nnight of lamentation.",
        "The children woke up and found out that something\r\nwas wrong, and they wailed and would not be comforted.",
        "In the morning,\r\nof course, most of them had to go to work, the packing houses would not\r\nstop for their sorrows; but by seven o’clock Ona and her stepmother\r\nwere standing at the door of the office of the agent.",
        "Yes, he told\r\nthem, when he came, it was quite true that they would have to pay\r\ninterest.",
        "And then Teta Elzbieta broke forth into protestations and\r\nreproaches, so that the people outside stopped and peered in at the\r\nwindow.",
        "The agent was as bland as ever.",
        "He was deeply pained, he said.",
        "He had not told them, simply because he had supposed they would\r\nunderstand that they had to pay interest upon their debt, as a matter\r\nof course.",
        "So they came away, and Ona went down to the yards, and at noontime saw\r\nJurgis and told him.",
        "Jurgis took it stolidly—he had made up his mind to\r\nit by this time.",
        "It was part of fate; they would manage it somehow—he\r\nmade his usual answer, “I will work harder.” It would upset their plans\r\nfor a time; and it would perhaps be necessary for Ona to get work after\r\nall.",
        "Then Ona added that Teta Elzbieta had decided that little\r\nStanislovas would have to work too.",
        "It was not fair to let Jurgis and\r\nher support the family—the family would have to help as it could.",
        "Previously Jurgis had scouted this idea, but now knit his brows and\r\nnodded his head slowly—yes, perhaps it would be best; they would all\r\nhave to make some sacrifices now.",
        "So Ona set out that day to hunt for work; and at night Marija came home\r\nsaying that she had met a girl named Jasaityte who had a friend that\r\nworked in one of the wrapping rooms in Brown’s, and might get a place\r\nfor Ona there; only the forelady was the kind that takes presents—it\r\nwas no use for any one to ask her for a place unless at the same time\r\nthey slipped a ten-dollar bill into her hand.",
        "Jurgis was not in the\r\nleast surprised at this now—he merely asked what the wages of the place\r\nwould be.",
        "So negotiations were opened, and after an interview Ona came\r\nhome and reported that the forelady seemed to like her, and had said\r\nthat, while she was not sure, she thought she might be able to put her\r\nat work sewing covers on hams, a job at which she would earn as much as\r\neight or ten dollars a week.",
        "That was a bid, so Marija reported, after\r\nconsulting her friend; and then there was an anxious conference at\r\nhome.",
        "The work was done in one of the cellars, and Jurgis did not want\r\nOna to work in such a place; but then it was easy work, and one could\r\nnot have everything.",
        "So in the end Ona, with a ten-dollar bill burning\r\na hole in her palm, had another interview with the forelady.",
        "Meantime Teta Elzbieta had taken Stanislovas to the priest and gotten a\r\ncertificate to the effect that he was two years older than he was; and\r\nwith it the little boy now sallied forth to make his fortune in the\r\nworld.",
        "It chanced that Durham had just put in a wonderful new lard\r\nmachine, and when the special policeman in front of the time station\r\nsaw Stanislovas and his document, he smiled to himself and told him to\r\ngo—“Czia!",
        "Czia!” pointing.",
        "And so Stanislovas went down a long stone\r\ncorridor, and up a flight of stairs, which took him into a room lighted\r\nby electricity, with the new machines for filling lard cans at work in\r\nit.",
        "The lard was finished on the floor above, and it came in little\r\njets, like beautiful, wriggling, snow-white snakes of unpleasant odor.",
        "There were several kinds and sizes of jets, and after a certain precise\r\nquantity had come out, each stopped automatically, and the wonderful\r\nmachine made a turn, and took the can under another jet, and so on,\r\nuntil it was filled neatly to the brim, and pressed tightly, and\r\nsmoothed off.",
        "To attend to all this and fill several hundred cans of\r\nlard per hour, there were necessary two human creatures, one of whom\r\nknew how to place an empty lard can on a certain spot every few\r\nseconds, and the other of whom knew how to take a full lard can off a\r\ncertain spot every few seconds and set it upon a tray.",
        "And so, after little Stanislovas had stood gazing timidly about him for\r\na few minutes, a man approached him, and asked what he wanted, to which\r\nStanislovas said, “Job.” Then the man said “How old?” and Stanislovas\r\nanswered, “Sixtin.” Once or twice every year a state inspector would\r\ncome wandering through the packing plants, asking a child here and\r\nthere how old he was; and so the packers were very careful to comply\r\nwith the law, which cost them as much trouble as was now involved in\r\nthe boss’s taking the document from the little boy, and glancing at it,\r\nand then sending it to the office to be filed away.",
        "Then he set some\r\none else at a different job, and showed the lad how to place a lard can\r\nevery time the empty arm of the remorseless machine came to him; and so\r\nwas decided the place in the universe of little Stanislovas, and his\r\ndestiny till the end of his days.",
        "Hour after hour, day after day, year\r\nafter year, it was fated that he should stand upon a certain square\r\nfoot of floor from seven in the morning until noon, and again from\r\nhalf-past twelve till half-past five, making never a motion and\r\nthinking never a thought, save for the setting of lard cans.",
        "In summer\r\nthe stench of the warm lard would be nauseating, and in winter the cans\r\nwould all but freeze to his naked little fingers in the unheated\r\ncellar.",
        "Half the year it would be dark as night when he went in to\r\nwork, and dark as night again when he came out, and so he would never\r\nknow what the sun looked like on weekdays.",
        "And for this, at the end of\r\nthe week, he would carry home three dollars to his family, being his\r\npay at the rate of five cents per hour—just about his proper share of\r\nthe total earnings of the million and three-quarters of children who\r\nare now engaged in earning their livings in the United States.",
        "And meantime, because they were young, and hope is not to be stifled\r\nbefore its time, Jurgis and Ona were again calculating; for they had\r\ndiscovered that the wages of Stanislovas would a little more than pay\r\nthe interest, which left them just about as they had been before!",
        "It\r\nwould be but fair to them to say that the little boy was delighted with\r\nhis work, and at the idea of earning a lot of money; and also that the\r\ntwo were very much in love with each other.",
        "CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll summer long the family toiled, and in the fall they had money\r\nenough for Jurgis and Ona to be married according to home traditions of\r\ndecency.",
        "In the latter part of November they hired a hall, and invited\r\nall their new acquaintances, who came and left them over a hundred\r\ndollars in debt.",
        "It was a bitter and cruel experience, and it plunged them into an agony\r\nof despair.",
        "Such a time, of all times, for them to have it, when their\r\nhearts were made tender!",
        "Such a pitiful beginning it was for their\r\nmarried life; they loved each other so, and they could not have the\r\nbriefest respite!",
        "It was a time when everything cried out to them that\r\nthey ought to be happy; when wonder burned in their hearts, and leaped\r\ninto flame at the slightest breath.",
        "They were shaken to the depths of\r\nthem, with the awe of love realized—and was it so very weak of them\r\nthat they cried out for a little peace?",
        "They had opened their hearts,\r\nlike flowers to the springtime, and the merciless winter had fallen\r\nupon them.",
        "They wondered if ever any love that had blossomed in the\r\nworld had been so crushed and trampled!",
        "Over them, relentless and savage, there cracked the lash of want; the\r\nmorning after the wedding it sought them as they slept, and drove them\r\nout before daybreak to work.",
        "Ona was scarcely able to stand with\r\nexhaustion; but if she were to lose her place they would be ruined, and\r\nshe would surely lose it if she were not on time that day.",
        "They all had\r\nto go, even little Stanislovas, who was ill from overindulgence in\r\nsausages and sarsaparilla.",
        "All that day he stood at his lard machine,\r\nrocking unsteadily, his eyes closing in spite of him; and he all but\r\nlost his place even so, for the foreman booted him twice to waken him.",
        "It was fully a week before they were all normal again, and meantime,\r\nwith whining children and cross adults, the house was not a pleasant\r\nplace to live in.",
        "Jurgis lost his temper very little, however, all\r\nthings considered.",
        "It was because of Ona; the least glance at her was\r\nalways enough to make him control himself.",
        "She was so sensitive—she was\r\nnot fitted for such a life as this; and a hundred times a day, when he\r\nthought of her, he would clench his hands and fling himself again at\r\nthe task before him.",
        "She was too good for him, he told himself, and he\r\nwas afraid, because she was his.",
        "So long he had hungered to possess\r\nher, but now that the time had come he knew that he had not earned the\r\nright; that she trusted him so was all her own simple goodness, and no\r\nvirtue of his.",
        "But he was resolved that she should never find this out,\r\nand so was always on the watch to see that he did not betray any of his\r\nugly self; he would take care even in little matters, such as his\r\nmanners, and his habit of swearing when things went wrong.",
        "The tears\r\ncame so easily into Ona’s eyes, and she would look at him so\r\nappealingly—it kept Jurgis quite busy making resolutions, in addition\r\nto all the other things he had on his mind.",
        "It was true that more\r\nthings were going on at this time in the mind of Jurgis than ever had\r\nin all his life before.",
        "He had to protect her, to do battle for her against the horror he saw\r\nabout them.",
        "He was all that she had to look to, and if he failed she\r\nwould be lost; he would wrap his arms about her, and try to hide her\r\nfrom the world.",
        "He had learned the ways of things about him now.",
        "It was\r\na war of each against all, and the devil take the hindmost.",
        "You did not\r\ngive feasts to other people, you waited for them to give feasts to you.",
        "You went about with your soul full of suspicion and hatred; you\r\nunderstood that you were environed by hostile powers that were trying\r\nto get your money, and who used all the virtues to bait their traps\r\nwith.",
        "The store-keepers plastered up their windows with all sorts of\r\nlies to entice you; the very fences by the wayside, the lampposts and\r\ntelegraph poles, were pasted over with lies.",
        "The great corporation\r\nwhich employed you lied to you, and lied to the whole country—from top\r\nto bottom it was nothing but one gigantic lie.",
        "So Jurgis said that he understood it; and yet it was really pitiful,\r\nfor the struggle was so unfair—some had so much the advantage!",
        "Here he\r\nwas, for instance, vowing upon his knees that he would save Ona from\r\nharm, and only a week later she was suffering atrociously, and from the\r\nblow of an enemy that he could not possibly have thwarted.",
        "There came a\r\nday when the rain fell in torrents; and it being December, to be wet\r\nwith it and have to sit all day long in one of the cold cellars of\r\nBrown’s was no laughing matter.",
        "Ona was a working girl, and did not own\r\nwaterproofs and such things, and so Jurgis took her and put her on the\r\nstreetcar.",
        "Now it chanced that this car line was owned by gentlemen who\r\nwere trying to make money.",
        "And the city having passed an ordinance\r\nrequiring them to give transfers, they had fallen into a rage; and\r\nfirst they had made a rule that transfers could be had only when the\r\nfare was paid; and later, growing still uglier, they had made\r\nanother—that the passenger must ask for the transfer, the conductor was\r\nnot allowed to offer it.",
        "Now Ona had been told that she was to get a\r\ntransfer; but it was not her way to speak up, and so she merely waited,\r\nfollowing the conductor about with her eyes, wondering when he would\r\nthink of her.",
        "When at last the time came for her to get out, she asked\r\nfor the transfer, and was refused.",
        "Not knowing what to make of this,\r\nshe began to argue with the conductor, in a language of which he did\r\nnot understand a word.",
        "After warning her several times, he pulled the\r\nbell and the car went on—at which Ona burst into tears.",
        "At the next\r\ncorner she got out, of course; and as she had no more money, she had to\r\nwalk the rest of the way to the yards in the pouring rain.",
        "And so all\r\nday long she sat shivering, and came home at night with her teeth\r\nchattering and pains in her head and back.",
        "For two weeks afterward she\r\nsuffered cruelly—and yet every day she had to drag herself to her work.",
        "The forewoman was especially severe with Ona, because she believed that\r\nshe was obstinate on account of having been refused a holiday the day\r\nafter her wedding.",
        "Ona had an idea that her “forelady” did not like to\r\nhave her girls marry—perhaps because she was old and ugly and unmarried\r\nherself.",
        "There were many such dangers, in which the odds were all against them.",
        "Their children were not as well as they had been at home; but how could\r\nthey know that there was no sewer to their house, and that the drainage\r\nof fifteen years was in a cesspool under it?",
        "How could they know that\r\nthe pale-blue milk that they bought around the corner was watered, and\r\ndoctored with formaldehyde besides?",
        "When the children were not well at\r\nhome, Teta Elzbieta would gather herbs and cure them; now she was\r\nobliged to go to the drugstore and buy extracts—and how was she to know\r\nthat they were all adulterated?",
        "How could they find out that their tea\r\nand coffee, their sugar and flour, had been doctored; that their canned\r\npeas had been colored with copper salts, and their fruit jams with\r\naniline dyes?",
        "And even if they had known it, what good would it have\r\ndone them, since there was no place within miles of them where any\r\nother sort was to be had?",
        "The bitter winter was coming, and they had to\r\nsave money to get more clothing and bedding; but it would not matter in\r\nthe least how much they saved, they could not get anything to keep them\r\nwarm.",
        "All the clothing that was to be had in the stores was made of\r\ncotton and shoddy, which is made by tearing old clothes to pieces and\r\nweaving the fiber again.",
        "If they paid higher prices, they might get\r\nfrills and fanciness, or be cheated; but genuine quality they could not\r\nobtain for love nor money.",
        "A young friend of Szedvilas’, recently come\r\nfrom abroad, had become a clerk in a store on Ashland Avenue, and he\r\nnarrated with glee a trick that had been played upon an unsuspecting\r\ncountryman by his boss.",
        "The customer had desired to purchase an alarm\r\nclock, and the boss had shown him two exactly similar, telling him that\r\nthe price of one was a dollar and of the other a dollar seventy-five.",
        "Upon being asked what the difference was, the man had wound up the\r\nfirst halfway and the second all the way, and showed the customer how\r\nthe latter made twice as much noise; upon which the customer remarked\r\nthat he was a sound sleeper, and had better take the more expensive\r\nclock!",
        "There is a poet who sings that\r\n\r\n\r\n“Deeper their heart grows and nobler their bearing,\r\nWhose youth in the fires of anguish hath died.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it was not likely that he had reference to the kind of anguish that\r\ncomes with destitution, that is so endlessly bitter and cruel, and yet\r\nso sordid and petty, so ugly, so humiliating—unredeemed by the\r\nslightest touch of dignity or even of pathos.",
        "It is a kind of anguish\r\nthat poets have not commonly dealt with; its very words are not\r\nadmitted into the vocabulary of poets—the details of it cannot be told\r\nin polite society at all.",
        "How, for instance, could any one expect to\r\nexcite sympathy among lovers of good literature by telling how a family\r\nfound their home alive with vermin, and of all the suffering and\r\ninconvenience and humiliation they were put to, and the hard-earned\r\nmoney they spent, in efforts to get rid of them?",
        "After long hesitation\r\nand uncertainty they paid twenty-five cents for a big package of insect\r\npowder—a patent preparation which chanced to be ninety-five per cent\r\ngypsum, a harmless earth which had cost about two cents to prepare.",
        "Of\r\ncourse it had not the least effect, except upon a few roaches which had\r\nthe misfortune to drink water after eating it, and so got their inwards\r\nset in a coating of plaster of Paris.",
        "The family, having no idea of\r\nthis, and no more money to throw away, had nothing to do but give up\r\nand submit to one more misery for the rest of their days.",
        "Then there was old Antanas.",
        "The winter came, and the place where he\r\nworked was a dark, unheated cellar, where you could see your breath all\r\nday, and where your fingers sometimes tried to freeze.",
        "So the old man’s\r\ncough grew every day worse, until there came a time when it hardly ever\r\nstopped, and he had become a nuisance about the place.",
        "Then, too, a\r\nstill more dreadful thing happened to him; he worked in a place where\r\nhis feet were soaked in chemicals, and it was not long before they had\r\neaten through his new boots.",
        "Then sores began to break out on his feet,\r\nand grow worse and worse.",
        "Whether it was that his blood was bad, or\r\nthere had been a cut, he could not say; but he asked the men about it,\r\nand learned that it was a regular thing—it was the saltpeter.",
        "Every one\r\nfelt it, sooner or later, and then it was all up with him, at least for\r\nthat sort of work.",
        "The sores would never heal—in the end his toes would\r\ndrop off, if he did not quit.",
        "Yet old Antanas would not quit; he saw\r\nthe suffering of his family, and he remembered what it had cost him to\r\nget a job.",
        "So he tied up his feet, and went on limping about and\r\ncoughing, until at last he fell to pieces, all at once and in a heap,\r\nlike the One-Horse Shay.",
        "They carried him to a dry place and laid him\r\non the floor, and that night two of the men helped him home.",
        "The poor\r\nold man was put to bed, and though he tried it every morning until the\r\nend, he never could get up again.",
        "He would lie there and cough and\r\ncough, day and night, wasting away to a mere skeleton.",
        "There came a\r\ntime when there was so little flesh on him that the bones began to poke\r\nthrough—which was a horrible thing to see or even to think of.",
        "And one\r\nnight he had a choking fit, and a little river of blood came out of his\r\nmouth.",
        "The family, wild with terror, sent for a doctor, and paid half a\r\ndollar to be told that there was nothing to be done.",
        "Mercifully the\r\ndoctor did not say this so that the old man could hear, for he was\r\nstill clinging to the faith that tomorrow or next day he would be\r\nbetter, and could go back to his job.",
        "The company had sent word to him\r\nthat they would keep it for him—or rather Jurgis had bribed one of the\r\nmen to come one Sunday afternoon and say they had.",
        "Dede Antanas\r\ncontinued to believe it, while three more hemorrhages came; and then at\r\nlast one morning they found him stiff and cold.",
        "Things were not going\r\nwell with them then, and though it nearly broke Teta Elzbieta’s heart,\r\nthey were forced to dispense with nearly all the decencies of a\r\nfuneral; they had only a hearse, and one hack for the women and\r\nchildren; and Jurgis, who was learning things fast, spent all Sunday\r\nmaking a bargain for these, and he made it in the presence of\r\nwitnesses, so that when the man tried to charge him for all sorts of\r\nincidentals, he did not have to pay.",
        "For twenty-five years old Antanas\r\nRudkus and his son had dwelt in the forest together, and it was hard to\r\npart in this way; perhaps it was just as well that Jurgis had to give\r\nall his attention to the task of having a funeral without being\r\nbankrupted, and so had no time to indulge in memories and grief.",
        "Now the dreadful winter was come upon them.",
        "In the forests, all summer\r\nlong, the branches of the trees do battle for light, and some of them\r\nlose and die; and then come the raging blasts, and the storms of snow\r\nand hail, and strew the ground with these weaker branches.",
        "Just so it\r\nwas in Packingtown; the whole district braced itself for the struggle\r\nthat was an agony, and those whose time was come died off in hordes.",
        "All the year round they had been serving as cogs in the great packing\r\nmachine; and now was the time for the renovating of it, and the\r\nreplacing of damaged parts.",
        "There came pneumonia and grippe, stalking\r\namong them, seeking for weakened constitutions; there was the annual\r\nharvest of those whom tuberculosis had been dragging down.",
        "There came\r\ncruel, cold, and biting winds, and blizzards of snow, all testing\r\nrelentlessly for failing muscles and impoverished blood.",
        "Sooner or\r\nlater came the day when the unfit one did not report for work; and\r\nthen, with no time lost in waiting, and no inquiries or regrets, there\r\nwas a chance for a new hand.",
        "The new hands were here by the thousands.",
        "All day long the gates of the\r\npacking houses were besieged by starving and penniless men; they came,\r\nliterally, by the thousands every single morning, fighting with each\r\nother for a chance for life.",
        "Blizzards and cold made no difference to\r\nthem, they were always on hand; they were on hand two hours before the\r\nsun rose, an hour before the work began.",
        "Sometimes their faces froze,\r\nsometimes their feet and their hands; sometimes they froze all\r\ntogether—but still they came, for they had no other place to go.",
        "One\r\nday Durham advertised in the paper for two hundred men to cut ice; and\r\nall that day the homeless and starving of the city came trudging\r\nthrough the snow from all over its two hundred square miles.",
        "That night\r\nforty score of them crowded into the station house of the stockyards\r\ndistrict—they filled the rooms, sleeping in each other’s laps, toboggan\r\nfashion, and they piled on top of each other in the corridors, till the\r\npolice shut the doors and left some to freeze outside.",
        "On the morrow,\r\nbefore daybreak, there were three thousand at Durham’s, and the police\r\nreserves had to be sent for to quell the riot.",
        "Then Durham’s bosses\r\npicked out twenty of the biggest; the “two hundred” proved to have been\r\na printer’s error.",
        "Four or five miles to the eastward lay the lake, and over this the\r\nbitter winds came raging.",
        "Sometimes the thermometer would fall to ten\r\nor twenty degrees below zero at night, and in the morning the streets\r\nwould be piled with snowdrifts up to the first-floor windows.",
        "The\r\nstreets through which our friends had to go to their work were all\r\nunpaved and full of deep holes and gullies; in summer, when it rained\r\nhard, a man might have to wade to his waist to get to his house; and\r\nnow in winter it was no joke getting through these places, before light\r\nin the morning and after dark at night.",
        "They would wrap up in all they\r\nowned, but they could not wrap up against exhaustion; and many a man\r\ngave out in these battles with the snowdrifts, and lay down and fell\r\nasleep.",
        "And if it was bad for the men, one may imagine how the women and\r\nchildren fared.",
        "Some would ride in the cars, if the cars were running;\r\nbut when you are making only five cents an hour, as was little\r\nStanislovas, you do not like to spend that much to ride two miles.",
        "The\r\nchildren would come to the yards with great shawls about their ears,\r\nand so tied up that you could hardly find them—and still there would be\r\naccidents.",
        "One bitter morning in February the little boy who worked at\r\nthe lard machine with Stanislovas came about an hour late, and\r\nscreaming with pain.",
        "They unwrapped him, and a man began vigorously\r\nrubbing his ears; and as they were frozen stiff, it took only two or\r\nthree rubs to break them short off.",
        "As a result of this, little\r\nStanislovas conceived a terror of the cold that was almost a mania.",
        "Every morning, when it came time to start for the yards, he would begin\r\nto cry and protest.",
        "Nobody knew quite how to manage him, for threats\r\ndid no good—it seemed to be something that he could not control, and\r\nthey feared sometimes that he would go into convulsions.",
        "In the end it\r\nhad to be arranged that he always went with Jurgis, and came home with\r\nhim again; and often, when the snow was deep, the man would carry him\r\nthe whole way on his shoulders.",
        "Sometimes Jurgis would be working until\r\nlate at night, and then it was pitiful, for there was no place for the\r\nlittle fellow to wait, save in the doorways or in a corner of the\r\nkilling beds, and he would all but fall asleep there, and freeze to\r\ndeath.",
        "There was no heat upon the killing beds; the men might exactly as well\r\nhave worked out of doors all winter.",
        "For that matter, there was very\r\nlittle heat anywhere in the building, except in the cooking rooms and\r\nsuch places—and it was the men who worked in these who ran the most\r\nrisk of all, because whenever they had to pass to another room they had\r\nto go through ice-cold corridors, and sometimes with nothing on above\r\nthe waist except a sleeveless undershirt.",
        "On the killing beds you were\r\napt to be covered with blood, and it would freeze solid; if you leaned\r\nagainst a pillar, you would freeze to that, and if you put your hand\r\nupon the blade of your knife, you would run a chance of leaving your\r\nskin on it.",
        "The men would tie up their feet in newspapers and old\r\nsacks, and these would be soaked in blood and frozen, and then soaked\r\nagain, and so on, until by nighttime a man would be walking on great\r\nlumps the size of the feet of an elephant.",
        "Now and then, when the\r\nbosses were not looking, you would see them plunging their feet and\r\nankles into the steaming hot carcass of the steer, or darting across\r\nthe room to the hot-water jets.",
        "The cruelest thing of all was that\r\nnearly all of them—all of those who used knives—were unable to wear\r\ngloves, and their arms would be white with frost and their hands would\r\ngrow numb, and then of course there would be accidents.",
        "Also the air\r\nwould be full of steam, from the hot water and the hot blood, so that\r\nyou could not see five feet before you; and then, with men rushing\r\nabout at the speed they kept up on the killing beds, and all with\r\nbutcher knives, like razors, in their hands—well, it was to be counted\r\nas a wonder that there were not more men slaughtered than cattle.",
        "And yet all this inconvenience they might have put up with, if only it\r\nhad not been for one thing—if only there had been some place where they\r\nmight eat.",
        "Jurgis had either to eat his dinner amid the stench in which\r\nhe had worked, or else to rush, as did all his companions, to any one\r\nof the hundreds of liquor stores which stretched out their arms to him.",
        "To the west of the yards ran Ashland Avenue, and here was an unbroken\r\nline of saloons—“Whiskey Row,” they called it; to the north was\r\nForty-seventh Street, where there were half a dozen to the block, and\r\nat the angle of the two was “Whiskey Point,” a space of fifteen or\r\ntwenty acres, and containing one glue factory and about two hundred\r\nsaloons.",
        "One might walk among these and take his choice: “Hot pea-soup and\r\nboiled cabbage today.” “Sauerkraut and hot frankfurters.",
        "Walk in.”\r\n“Bean soup and stewed lamb.",
        "Welcome.” All of these things were printed\r\nin many languages, as were also the names of the resorts, which were\r\ninfinite in their variety and appeal.",
        "There was the “Home Circle” and\r\nthe “Cosey Corner”; there were “Firesides” and “Hearthstones” and\r\n“Pleasure Palaces” and “Wonderlands” and “Dream Castles” and “Love’s\r\nDelights.” Whatever else they were called, they were sure to be called\r\n“Union Headquarters,” and to hold out a welcome to workingmen; and\r\nthere was always a warm stove, and a chair near it, and some friends to\r\nlaugh and talk with.",
        "There was only one condition attached,—you must\r\ndrink.",
        "If you went in not intending to drink, you would be put out in\r\nno time, and if you were slow about going, like as not you would get\r\nyour head split open with a beer bottle in the bargain.",
        "But all of the\r\nmen understood the convention and drank; they believed that by it they\r\nwere getting something for nothing—for they did not need to take more\r\nthan one drink, and upon the strength of it they might fill themselves\r\nup with a good hot dinner.",
        "This did not always work out in practice,\r\nhowever, for there was pretty sure to be a friend who would treat you,\r\nand then you would have to treat him.",
        "Then some one else would come\r\nin—and, anyhow, a few drinks were good for a man who worked hard.",
        "As he\r\nwent back he did not shiver so, he had more courage for his task; the\r\ndeadly brutalizing monotony of it did not afflict him so,—he had ideas\r\nwhile he worked, and took a more cheerful view of his circumstances.",
        "On\r\nthe way home, however, the shivering was apt to come on him again; and\r\nso he would have to stop once or twice to warm up against the cruel\r\ncold.",
        "As there were hot things to eat in this saloon too, he might get\r\nhome late to his supper, or he might not get home at all.",
        "And then his\r\nwife might set out to look for him, and she too would feel the cold;\r\nand perhaps she would have some of the children with her—and so a whole\r\nfamily would drift into drinking, as the current of a river drifts\r\ndownstream.",
        "As if to complete the chain, the packers all paid their men\r\nin checks, refusing all requests to pay in coin; and where in\r\nPackingtown could a man go to have his check cashed but to a saloon,\r\nwhere he could pay for the favor by spending a part of the money?",
        "From all of these things Jurgis was saved because of Ona.",
        "He never\r\nwould take but the one drink at noontime; and so he got the reputation\r\nof being a surly fellow, and was not quite welcome at the saloons, and\r\nhad to drift about from one to another.",
        "Then at night he would go\r\nstraight home, helping Ona and Stanislovas, or often putting the former\r\non a car.",
        "And when he got home perhaps he would have to trudge several\r\nblocks, and come staggering back through the snowdrifts with a bag of\r\ncoal upon his shoulder.",
        "Home was not a very attractive place—at least\r\nnot this winter.",
        "They had only been able to buy one stove, and this was\r\na small one, and proved not big enough to warm even the kitchen in the\r\nbitterest weather.",
        "This made it hard for Teta Elzbieta all day, and for\r\nthe children when they could not get to school.",
        "At night they would sit\r\nhuddled round this stove, while they ate their supper off their laps;\r\nand then Jurgis and Jonas would smoke a pipe, after which they would\r\nall crawl into their beds to get warm, after putting out the fire to\r\nsave the coal.",
        "Then they would have some frightful experiences with the\r\ncold.",
        "They would sleep with all their clothes on, including their\r\novercoats, and put over them all the bedding and spare clothing they\r\nowned; the children would sleep all crowded into one bed, and yet even\r\nso they could not keep warm.",
        "The outside ones would be shivering and\r\nsobbing, crawling over the others and trying to get down into the\r\ncenter, and causing a fight.",
        "This old house with the leaky\r\nweatherboards was a very different thing from their cabins at home,\r\nwith great thick walls plastered inside and outside with mud; and the\r\ncold which came upon them was a living thing, a demon-presence in the\r\nroom.",
        "They would waken in the midnight hours, when everything was\r\nblack; perhaps they would hear it yelling outside, or perhaps there\r\nwould be deathlike stillness—and that would be worse yet.",
        "They could\r\nfeel the cold as it crept in through the cracks, reaching out for them\r\nwith its icy, death-dealing fingers; and they would crouch and cower,\r\nand try to hide from it, all in vain.",
        "It would come, and it would come;\r\na grisly thing, a specter born in the black caverns of terror; a power\r\nprimeval, cosmic, shadowing the tortures of the lost souls flung out to\r\nchaos and destruction.",
        "It was cruel iron-hard; and hour after hour they\r\nwould cringe in its grasp, alone, alone.",
        "There would be no one to hear\r\nthem if they cried out; there would be no help, no mercy.",
        "And so on\r\nuntil morning—when they would go out to another day of toil, a little\r\nweaker, a little nearer to the time when it would be their turn to be\r\nshaken from the tree.",
        "CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nYet even by this deadly winter the germ of hope was not to be kept from\r\nsprouting in their hearts.",
        "It was just at this time that the great\r\nadventure befell Marija.",
        "The victim was Tamoszius Kuszleika, who played the violin.",
        "Everybody\r\nlaughed at them, for Tamoszius was petite and frail, and Marija could\r\nhave picked him up and carried him off under one arm.",
        "But perhaps that\r\nwas why she fascinated him; the sheer volume of Marija’s energy was\r\noverwhelming.",
        "That first night at the wedding Tamoszius had hardly\r\ntaken his eyes off her; and later on, when he came to find that she had\r\nreally the heart of a baby, her voice and her violence ceased to\r\nterrify him, and he got the habit of coming to pay her visits on Sunday\r\nafternoons.",
        "There was no place to entertain company except in the\r\nkitchen, in the midst of the family, and Tamoszius would sit there with\r\nhis hat between his knees, never saying more than half a dozen words at\r\na time, and turning red in the face before he managed to say those;\r\nuntil finally Jurgis would clap him upon the back, in his hearty way,\r\ncrying, “Come now, brother, give us a tune.” And then Tamoszius’ face\r\nwould light up and he would get out his fiddle, tuck it under his chin,\r\nand play.",
        "And forthwith the soul of him would flame up and become\r\neloquent—it was almost an impropriety, for all the while his gaze would\r\nbe fixed upon Marija’s face, until she would begin to turn red and\r\nlower her eyes.",
        "There was no resisting the music of Tamoszius, however;\r\neven the children would sit awed and wondering, and the tears would run\r\ndown Teta Elzbieta’s cheeks.",
        "A wonderful privilege it was to be thus\r\nadmitted into the soul of a man of genius, to be allowed to share the\r\necstasies and the agonies of his inmost life.",
        "Then there were other benefits accruing to Marija from this\r\nfriendship—benefits of a more substantial nature.",
        "People paid Tamoszius\r\nbig money to come and make music on state occasions; and also they\r\nwould invite him to parties and festivals, knowing well that he was too\r\ngood-natured to come without his fiddle, and that having brought it, he\r\ncould be made to play while others danced.",
        "Once he made bold to ask\r\nMarija to accompany him to such a party, and Marija accepted, to his\r\ngreat delight—after which he never went anywhere without her, while if\r\nthe celebration were given by friends of his, he would invite the rest\r\nof the family also.",
        "In any case Marija would bring back a huge\r\npocketful of cakes and sandwiches for the children, and stories of all\r\nthe good things she herself had managed to consume.",
        "She was compelled,\r\nat these parties, to spend most of her time at the refreshment table,\r\nfor she could not dance with anybody except other women and very old\r\nmen; Tamoszius was of an excitable temperament, and afflicted with a\r\nfrantic jealousy, and any unmarried man who ventured to put his arm\r\nabout the ample waist of Marija would be certain to throw the orchestra\r\nout of tune.",
        "It was a great help to a person who had to toil all the week to be able\r\nto look forward to some such relaxation as this on Saturday nights.",
        "The\r\nfamily was too poor and too hardworked to make many acquaintances; in\r\nPackingtown, as a rule, people know only their near neighbors and\r\nshopmates, and so the place is like a myriad of little country\r\nvillages.",
        "But now there was a member of the family who was permitted to\r\ntravel and widen her horizon; and so each week there would be new\r\npersonalities to talk about,—how so-and-so was dressed, and where she\r\nworked, and what she got, and whom she was in love with; and how this\r\nman had jilted his girl, and how she had quarreled with the other girl,\r\nand what had passed between them; and how another man beat his wife,\r\nand spent all her earnings upon drink, and pawned her very clothes.",
        "Some people would have scorned this talk as gossip; but then one has to\r\ntalk about what one knows.",
        "It was one Saturday night, as they were coming home from a wedding,\r\nthat Tamoszius found courage, and set down his violin case in the\r\nstreet and spoke his heart; and then Marija clasped him in her arms.",
        "She told them all about it the next day, and fairly cried with\r\nhappiness, for she said that Tamoszius was a lovely man.",
        "After that he\r\nno longer made love to her with his fiddle, but they would sit for\r\nhours in the kitchen, blissfully happy in each other’s arms; it was the\r\ntacit convention of the family to know nothing of what was going on in\r\nthat corner.",
        "They were planning to be married in the spring, and have the garret of\r\nthe house fixed up, and live there.",
        "Tamoszius made good wages; and\r\nlittle by little the family were paying back their debt to Marija, so\r\nshe ought soon to have enough to start life upon—only, with her\r\npreposterous softheartedness, she would insist upon spending a good\r\npart of her money every week for things which she saw they needed.",
        "Marija was really the capitalist of the party, for she had become an\r\nexpert can painter by this time—she was getting fourteen cents for\r\nevery hundred and ten cans, and she could paint more than two cans\r\nevery minute.",
        "Marija felt, so to speak, that she had her hand on the\r\nthrottle, and the neighborhood was vocal with her rejoicings.",
        "Yet her friends would shake their heads and tell her to go slow; one\r\ncould not count upon such good fortune forever—there were accidents\r\nthat always happened.",
        "But Marija was not to be prevailed upon, and went\r\non planning and dreaming of all the treasures she was going to have for\r\nher home; and so, when the crash did come, her grief was painful to\r\nsee.",
        "For her canning factory shut down!",
        "Marija would about as soon have\r\nexpected to see the sun shut down—the huge establishment had been to\r\nher a thing akin to the planets and the seasons.",
        "But now it was shut!",
        "And they had not given her any explanation, they had not even given her\r\na day’s warning; they had simply posted a notice one Saturday that all\r\nhands would be paid off that afternoon, and would not resume work for\r\nat least a month!",
        "And that was all that there was to it—her job was\r\ngone!",
        "It was the holiday rush that was over, the girls said in answer to\r\nMarija’s inquiries; after that there was always a slack.",
        "Sometimes the\r\nfactory would start up on half time after a while, but there was no\r\ntelling—it had been known to stay closed until way into the summer.",
        "The\r\nprospects were bad at present, for truckmen who worked in the\r\nstorerooms said that these were piled up to the ceilings, so that the\r\nfirm could not have found room for another week’s output of cans.",
        "And\r\nthey had turned off three-quarters of these men, which was a still\r\nworse sign, since it meant that there were no orders to be filled.",
        "It\r\nwas all a swindle, can-painting, said the girls—you were crazy with\r\ndelight because you were making twelve or fourteen dollars a week, and\r\nsaving half of it; but you had to spend it all keeping alive while you\r\nwere out, and so your pay was really only half what you thought.",
        "Marija came home, and because she was a person who could not rest\r\nwithout danger of explosion, they first had a great house cleaning, and\r\nthen she set out to search Packingtown for a job to fill up the gap.",
        "As\r\nnearly all the canning establishments were shut down, and all the girls\r\nhunting work, it will be readily understood that Marija did not find\r\nany.",
        "Then she took to trying the stores and saloons, and when this\r\nfailed she even traveled over into the far-distant regions near the\r\nlake front, where lived the rich people in great palaces, and begged\r\nthere for some sort of work that could be done by a person who did not\r\nknow English.",
        "The men upon the killing beds felt also the effects of the slump which\r\nhad turned Marija out; but they felt it in a different way, and a way\r\nwhich made Jurgis understand at last all their bitterness.",
        "The big\r\npackers did not turn their hands off and close down, like the canning\r\nfactories; but they began to run for shorter and shorter hours.",
        "They\r\nhad always required the men to be on the killing beds and ready for\r\nwork at seven o’clock, although there was almost never any work to be\r\ndone till the buyers out in the yards had gotten to work, and some\r\ncattle had come over the chutes.",
        "That would often be ten or eleven\r\no’clock, which was bad enough, in all conscience; but now, in the slack\r\nseason, they would perhaps not have a thing for their men to do till\r\nlate in the afternoon.",
        "And so they would have to loaf around, in a\r\nplace where the thermometer might be twenty degrees below zero!",
        "At\r\nfirst one would see them running about, or skylarking with each other,\r\ntrying to keep warm; but before the day was over they would become\r\nquite chilled through and exhausted, and, when the cattle finally came,\r\nso near frozen that to move was an agony.",
        "And then suddenly the place\r\nwould spring into activity, and the merciless “speeding-up” would\r\nbegin!",
        "There were weeks at a time when Jurgis went home after such a day as\r\nthis with not more than two hours’ work to his credit—which meant about\r\nthirty-five cents.",
        "There were many days when the total was less than\r\nhalf an hour, and others when there was none at all.",
        "The general\r\naverage was six hours a day, which meant for Jurgis about six dollars a\r\nweek; and this six hours of work would be done after standing on the\r\nkilling bed till one o’clock, or perhaps even three or four o’clock, in\r\nthe afternoon.",
        "Like as not there would come a rush of cattle at the\r\nvery end of the day, which the men would have to dispose of before they\r\nwent home, often working by electric light till nine or ten, or even\r\ntwelve or one o’clock, and without a single instant for a bite of\r\nsupper.",
        "The men were at the mercy of the cattle.",
        "Perhaps the buyers\r\nwould be holding off for better prices—if they could scare the shippers\r\ninto thinking that they meant to buy nothing that day, they could get\r\ntheir own terms.",
        "For some reason the cost of fodder for cattle in the\r\nyards was much above the market price—and you were not allowed to bring\r\nyour own fodder!",
        "Then, too, a number of cars were apt to arrive late in\r\nthe day, now that the roads were blocked with snow, and the packers\r\nwould buy their cattle that night, to get them cheaper, and then would\r\ncome into play their ironclad rule, that all cattle must be killed the\r\nsame day they were bought.",
        "There was no use kicking about this—there\r\nhad been one delegation after another to see the packers about it, only\r\nto be told that it was the rule, and that there was not the slightest\r\nchance of its ever being altered.",
        "And so on Christmas Eve Jurgis worked\r\ntill nearly one o’clock in the morning, and on Christmas Day he was on\r\nthe killing bed at seven o’clock.",
        "All this was bad; and yet it was not the worst.",
        "For after all the hard\r\nwork a man did, he was paid for only part of it.",
        "Jurgis had once been\r\namong those who scoffed at the idea of these huge concerns cheating;\r\nand so now he could appreciate the bitter irony of the fact that it was\r\nprecisely their size which enabled them to do it with impunity.",
        "One of\r\nthe rules on the killing beds was that a man who was one minute late\r\nwas docked an hour; and this was economical, for he was made to work\r\nthe balance of the hour—he was not allowed to stand round and wait.",
        "And\r\non the other hand if he came ahead of time he got no pay for\r\nthat—though often the bosses would start up the gang ten or fifteen\r\nminutes before the whistle.",
        "And this same custom they carried over to\r\nthe end of the day; they did not pay for any fraction of an hour—for\r\n“broken time.” A man might work full fifty minutes, but if there was no\r\nwork to fill out the hour, there was no pay for him.",
        "Thus the end of\r\nevery day was a sort of lottery—a struggle, all but breaking into open\r\nwar between the bosses and the men, the former trying to rush a job\r\nthrough and the latter trying to stretch it out.",
        "Jurgis blamed the\r\nbosses for this, though the truth to be told it was not always their\r\nfault; for the packers kept them frightened for their lives—and when\r\none was in danger of falling behind the standard, what was easier than\r\nto catch up by making the gang work awhile “for the church”?",
        "This was a\r\nsavage witticism the men had, which Jurgis had to have explained to\r\nhim.",
        "Old man Jones was great on missions and such things, and so\r\nwhenever they were doing some particularly disreputable job, the men\r\nwould wink at each other and say, “Now we’re working for the church!”\r\n\r\nOne of the consequences of all these things was that Jurgis was no\r\nlonger perplexed when he heard men talk of fighting for their rights.",
        "He felt like fighting now himself; and when the Irish delegate of the\r\nbutcher-helpers’ union came to him a second time, he received him in a\r\nfar different spirit.",
        "A wonderful idea it now seemed to Jurgis, this of\r\nthe men—that by combining they might be able to make a stand and\r\nconquer the packers!",
        "Jurgis wondered who had first thought of it; and\r\nwhen he was told that it was a common thing for men to do in America,\r\nhe got the first inkling of a meaning in the phrase “a free country.”\r\nThe delegate explained to him how it depended upon their being able to\r\nget every man to join and stand by the organization, and so Jurgis\r\nsignified that he was willing to do his share.",
        "Before another month was\r\nby, all the working members of his family had union cards, and wore\r\ntheir union buttons conspicuously and with pride.",
        "For fully a week they\r\nwere quite blissfully happy, thinking that belonging to a union meant\r\nan end to all their troubles.",
        "But only ten days after she had joined, Marija’s canning factory closed\r\ndown, and that blow quite staggered them.",
        "They could not understand why\r\nthe union had not prevented it, and the very first time she attended a\r\nmeeting Marija got up and made a speech about it.",
        "It was a business\r\nmeeting, and was transacted in English, but that made no difference to\r\nMarija; she said what was in her, and all the pounding of the\r\nchairman’s gavel and all the uproar and confusion in the room could not\r\nprevail.",
        "Quite apart from her own troubles she was boiling over with a\r\ngeneral sense of the injustice of it, and she told what she thought of\r\nthe packers, and what she thought of a world where such things were\r\nallowed to happen; and then, while the echoes of the hall rang with the\r\nshock of her terrible voice, she sat down again and fanned herself, and\r\nthe meeting gathered itself together and proceeded to discuss the\r\nelection of a recording secretary.",
        "Jurgis too had an adventure the first time he attended a union meeting,\r\nbut it was not of his own seeking.",
        "Jurgis had gone with the desire to\r\nget into an inconspicuous corner and see what was done; but this\r\nattitude of silent and open-eyed attention had marked him out for a\r\nvictim.",
        "Tommy Finnegan was a little Irishman, with big staring eyes and\r\na wild aspect, a “hoister” by trade, and badly cracked.",
        "Somewhere back\r\nin the far-distant past Tommy Finnegan had had a strange experience,\r\nand the burden of it rested upon him.",
        "All the balance of his life he\r\nhad done nothing but try to make it understood.",
        "When he talked he\r\ncaught his victim by the buttonhole, and his face kept coming closer\r\nand closer—which was trying, because his teeth were so bad.",
        "Jurgis did\r\nnot mind that, only he was frightened.",
        "The method of operation of the\r\nhigher intelligences was Tom Finnegan’s theme, and he desired to find\r\nout if Jurgis had ever considered that the representation of things in\r\ntheir present similarity might be altogether unintelligible upon a more\r\nelevated plane.",
        "There were assuredly wonderful mysteries about the\r\ndeveloping of these things; and then, becoming confidential, Mr.",
        "Finnegan proceeded to tell of some discoveries of his own.",
        "“If ye have\r\niver had onything to do wid shperrits,” said he, and looked inquiringly\r\nat Jurgis, who kept shaking his head.",
        "“Niver mind, niver mind,”\r\ncontinued the other, “but their influences may be operatin’ upon ye;\r\nit’s shure as I’m tellin’ ye, it’s them that has the reference to the\r\nimmejit surroundin’s that has the most of power.",
        "It was vouchsafed to\r\nme in me youthful days to be acquainted with shperrits” and so Tommy\r\nFinnegan went on, expounding a system of philosophy, while the\r\nperspiration came out on Jurgis’ forehead, so great was his agitation\r\nand embarrassment.",
        "In the end one of the men, seeing his plight, came\r\nover and rescued him; but it was some time before he was able to find\r\nany one to explain things to him, and meanwhile his fear lest the\r\nstrange little Irishman should get him cornered again was enough to\r\nkeep him dodging about the room the whole evening.",
        "He never missed a meeting, however.",
        "He had picked up a few words of\r\nEnglish by this time, and friends would help him to understand.",
        "They\r\nwere often very turbulent meetings, with half a dozen men declaiming at\r\nonce, in as many dialects of English; but the speakers were all\r\ndesperately in earnest, and Jurgis was in earnest too, for he\r\nunderstood that a fight was on, and that it was his fight.",
        "Since the\r\ntime of his disillusionment, Jurgis had sworn to trust no man, except\r\nin his own family; but here he discovered that he had brothers in\r\naffliction, and allies.",
        "Their one chance for life was in union, and so\r\nthe struggle became a kind of crusade.",
        "Jurgis had always been a member\r\nof the church, because it was the right thing to be, but the church had\r\nnever touched him, he left all that for the women.",
        "Here, however, was a\r\nnew religion—one that did touch him, that took hold of every fiber of\r\nhim; and with all the zeal and fury of a convert he went out as a\r\nmissionary.",
        "There were many nonunion men among the Lithuanians, and\r\nwith these he would labor and wrestle in prayer, trying to show them\r\nthe right.",
        "Sometimes they would be obstinate and refuse to see it, and\r\nJurgis, alas, was not always patient!",
        "He forgot how he himself had been\r\nblind, a short time ago—after the fashion of all crusaders since the\r\noriginal ones, who set out to spread the gospel of Brotherhood by force\r\nof arms.",
        "CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first consequences of the discovery of the union was that\r\nJurgis became desirous of learning English.",
        "He wanted to know what was\r\ngoing on at the meetings, and to be able to take part in them, and so\r\nhe began to look about him, and to try to pick up words.",
        "The children,\r\nwho were at school, and learning fast, would teach him a few; and a\r\nfriend loaned him a little book that had some in it, and Ona would read\r\nthem to him.",
        "Then Jurgis became sorry that he could not read himself;\r\nand later on in the winter, when some one told him that there was a\r\nnight school that was free, he went and enrolled.",
        "After that, every\r\nevening that he got home from the yards in time, he would go to the\r\nschool; he would go even if he were in time for only half an hour.",
        "They\r\nwere teaching him both to read and to speak English—and they would have\r\ntaught him other things, if only he had had a little time.",
        "Also the union made another great difference with him—it made him begin\r\nto pay attention to the country.",
        "It was the beginning of democracy with\r\nhim.",
        "It was a little state, the union, a miniature republic; its\r\naffairs were every man’s affairs, and every man had a real say about\r\nthem.",
        "In other words, in the union Jurgis learned to talk politics.",
        "In\r\nthe place where he had come from there had not been any politics—in\r\nRussia one thought of the government as an affliction like the\r\nlightning and the hail.",
        "“Duck, little brother, duck,” the wise old\r\npeasants would whisper; “everything passes away.” And when Jurgis had\r\nfirst come to America he had supposed that it was the same.",
        "He had\r\nheard people say that it was a free country—but what did that mean?",
        "He\r\nfound that here, precisely as in Russia, there were rich men who owned\r\neverything; and if one could not find any work, was not the hunger he\r\nbegan to feel the same sort of hunger?",
        "When Jurgis had been working about three weeks at Brown’s, there had\r\ncome to him one noontime a man who was employed as a night watchman,\r\nand who asked him if he would not like to take out naturalization\r\npapers and become a citizen.",
        "Jurgis did not know what that meant, but\r\nthe man explained the advantages.",
        "In the first place, it would not cost\r\nhim anything, and it would get him half a day off, with his pay just\r\nthe same; and then when election time came he would be able to vote—and\r\nthere was something in that.",
        "Jurgis was naturally glad to accept, and\r\nso the night watchman said a few words to the boss, and he was excused\r\nfor the rest of the day.",
        "When, later on, he wanted a holiday to get\r\nmarried he could not get it; and as for a holiday with pay just the\r\nsame—what power had wrought that miracle heaven only knew!",
        "However, he\r\nwent with the man, who picked up several other newly landed immigrants,\r\nPoles, Lithuanians, and Slovaks, and took them all outside, where stood\r\na great four-horse tallyho coach, with fifteen or twenty men already in\r\nit.",
        "It was a fine chance to see the sights of the city, and the party\r\nhad a merry time, with plenty of beer handed up from inside.",
        "So they\r\ndrove downtown and stopped before an imposing granite building, in\r\nwhich they interviewed an official, who had the papers all ready, with\r\nonly the names to be filled in.",
        "So each man in turn took an oath of\r\nwhich he did not understand a word, and then was presented with a\r\nhandsome ornamented document with a big red seal and the shield of the\r\nUnited States upon it, and was told that he had become a citizen of the\r\nRepublic and the equal of the President himself.",
        "A month or two later Jurgis had another interview with this same man,\r\nwho told him where to go to “register.” And then finally, when election\r\nday came, the packing houses posted a notice that men who desired to\r\nvote might remain away until nine that morning, and the same night\r\nwatchman took Jurgis and the rest of his flock into the back room of a\r\nsaloon, and showed each of them where and how to mark a ballot, and\r\nthen gave each two dollars, and took them to the polling place, where\r\nthere was a policeman on duty especially to see that they got through\r\nall right.",
        "Jurgis felt quite proud of this good luck till he got home\r\nand met Jonas, who had taken the leader aside and whispered to him,\r\noffering to vote three times for four dollars, which offer had been\r\naccepted.",
        "And now in the union Jurgis met men who explained all this mystery to\r\nhim; and he learned that America differed from Russia in that its\r\ngovernment existed under the form of a democracy.",
        "The officials who\r\nruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there\r\nwere two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the\r\none got the office which bought the most votes.",
        "Now and then, the\r\nelection was very close, and that was the time the poor man came in.",
        "In\r\nthe stockyards this was only in national and state elections, for in\r\nlocal elections the Democratic Party always carried everything.",
        "The\r\nruler of the district was therefore the Democratic boss, a little\r\nIrishman named Mike Scully.",
        "Scully held an important party office in\r\nthe state, and bossed even the mayor of the city, it was said; it was\r\nhis boast that he carried the stockyards in his pocket.",
        "He was an\r\nenormously rich man—he had a hand in all the big graft in the\r\nneighborhood.",
        "It was Scully, for instance, who owned that dump which\r\nJurgis and Ona had seen the first day of their arrival.",
        "Not only did he\r\nown the dump, but he owned the brick factory as well, and first he took\r\nout the clay and made it into bricks, and then he had the city bring\r\ngarbage to fill up the hole, so that he could build houses to sell to\r\nthe people.",
        "Then, too, he sold the bricks to the city, at his own\r\nprice, and the city came and got them in its own wagons.",
        "And also he\r\nowned the other hole near by, where the stagnant water was; and it was\r\nhe who cut the ice and sold it; and what was more, if the men told\r\ntruth, he had not had to pay any taxes for the water, and he had built\r\nthe ice-house out of city lumber, and had not had to pay anything for\r\nthat.",
        "The newspapers had got hold of that story, and there had been a\r\nscandal; but Scully had hired somebody to confess and take all the\r\nblame, and then skip the country.",
        "It was said, too, that he had built\r\nhis brick-kiln in the same way, and that the workmen were on the city\r\npayroll while they did it; however, one had to press closely to get\r\nthese things out of the men, for it was not their business, and Mike\r\nScully was a good man to stand in with.",
        "A note signed by him was equal\r\nto a job any time at the packing houses; and also he employed a good\r\nmany men himself, and worked them only eight hours a day, and paid them\r\nthe highest wages.",
        "This gave him many friends—all of whom he had gotten\r\ntogether into the “War Whoop League,” whose clubhouse you might see\r\njust outside of the yards.",
        "It was the biggest clubhouse, and the\r\nbiggest club, in all Chicago; and they had prizefights every now and\r\nthen, and cockfights and even dogfights.",
        "The policemen in the district\r\nall belonged to the league, and instead of suppressing the fights, they\r\nsold tickets for them.",
        "The man that had taken Jurgis to be naturalized\r\nwas one of these “Indians,” as they were called; and on election day\r\nthere would be hundreds of them out, and all with big wads of money in\r\ntheir pockets and free drinks at every saloon in the district.",
        "That was\r\nanother thing, the men said—all the saloon-keepers had to be “Indians,”\r\nand to put up on demand, otherwise they could not do business on\r\nSundays, nor have any gambling at all.",
        "In the same way Scully had all\r\nthe jobs in the fire department at his disposal, and all the rest of\r\nthe city graft in the stockyards district; he was building a block of\r\nflats somewhere up on Ashland Avenue, and the man who was overseeing it\r\nfor him was drawing pay as a city inspector of sewers.",
        "The city\r\ninspector of water pipes had been dead and buried for over a year, but\r\nsomebody was still drawing his pay.",
        "The city inspector of sidewalks was\r\na barkeeper at the War Whoop Cafe—and maybe he could make it\r\nuncomfortable for any tradesman who did not stand in with Scully!",
        "Even the packers were in awe of him, so the men said.",
        "It gave them\r\npleasure to believe this, for Scully stood as the people’s man, and\r\nboasted of it boldly when election day came.",
        "The packers had wanted a\r\nbridge at Ashland Avenue, but they had not been able to get it till\r\nthey had seen Scully; and it was the same with “Bubbly Creek,” which\r\nthe city had threatened to make the packers cover over, till Scully had\r\ncome to their aid.",
        "“Bubbly Creek” is an arm of the Chicago River, and\r\nforms the southern boundary of the yards: all the drainage of the\r\nsquare mile of packing houses empties into it, so that it is really a\r\ngreat open sewer a hundred or two feet wide.",
        "One long arm of it is\r\nblind, and the filth stays there forever and a day.",
        "The grease and\r\nchemicals that are poured into it undergo all sorts of strange\r\ntransformations, which are the cause of its name; it is constantly in\r\nmotion, as if huge fish were feeding in it, or great leviathans\r\ndisporting themselves in its depths.",
        "Bubbles of carbonic acid gas will\r\nrise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide.",
        "Here and there the grease and filth have caked solid, and the creek\r\nlooks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on it, feeding, and many\r\ntimes an unwary stranger has started to stroll across, and vanished\r\ntemporarily.",
        "The packers used to leave the creek that way, till every\r\nnow and then the surface would catch on fire and burn furiously, and\r\nthe fire department would have to come and put it out.",
        "Once, however,\r\nan ingenious stranger came and started to gather this filth in scows,\r\nto make lard out of; then the packers took the cue, and got out an\r\ninjunction to stop him, and afterward gathered it themselves.",
        "The banks\r\nof “Bubbly Creek” are plastered thick with hairs, and this also the\r\npackers gather and clean.",
        "And there were things even stranger than this, according to the gossip\r\nof the men.",
        "The packers had secret mains, through which they stole\r\nbillions of gallons of the city’s water.",
        "The newspapers had been full\r\nof this scandal—once there had even been an investigation, and an\r\nactual uncovering of the pipes; but nobody had been punished, and the\r\nthing went right on.",
        "And then there was the condemned meat industry,\r\nwith its endless horrors.",
        "The people of Chicago saw the government\r\ninspectors in Packingtown, and they all took that to mean that they\r\nwere protected from diseased meat; they did not understand that these\r\nhundred and sixty-three inspectors had been appointed at the request of\r\nthe packers, and that they were paid by the United States government to\r\ncertify that all the diseased meat was kept in the state.",
        "They had no\r\nauthority beyond that; for the inspection of meat to be sold in the\r\ncity and state the whole force in Packingtown consisted of three\r\nhenchmen of the local political machine![2] And shortly afterward one\r\nof these, a physician, made the discovery that the carcasses of steers\r\nwhich had been condemned as tubercular by the government inspectors,\r\nand which therefore contained ptomaines, which are deadly poisons, were\r\nleft upon an open platform and carted away to be sold in the city; and\r\nso he insisted that these carcasses be treated with an injection of\r\nkerosene—and was ordered to resign the same week!",
        "So indignant were the\r\npackers that they went farther, and compelled the mayor to abolish the\r\nwhole bureau of inspection; so that since then there has not been even\r\na pretense of any interference with the graft.",
        "There was said to be two\r\nthousand dollars a week hush money from the tubercular steers alone;\r\nand as much again from the hogs which had died of cholera on the\r\ntrains, and which you might see any day being loaded into boxcars and\r\nhauled away to a place called Globe, in Indiana, where they made a\r\nfancy grade of lard.",

        "United States Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Animal\r\n Industries, Order No.",

        "Proprietors of slaughterhouses, canning, salting,\r\n    packing, or rendering establishments engaged in the slaughtering of\r\n    cattle, sheep, or swine, or the packing of any of their products,\r\n    _the carcasses or products of which are to become subjects of\r\n    interstate or foreign commerce_, shall make application to the\r\n    Secretary of Agriculture for inspection of said animals and their\r\n    products....",

        "Such rejected or condemned animals shall at once be\r\n    removed by the owners from the pens containing animals which have\r\n    been inspected and found to be free from disease and fit for human\r\n    food, and _shall be disposed of in accordance with the laws,\r\n    ordinances, and regulations of the state and municipality in which\r\n    said rejected or condemned animals are located_....",
        "Section 25.",
        "A microscopic examination for trichinae shall be made\r\n    of all swine products exported to countries requiring such\r\n    examination.",
        "_No microscopic examination will be made of hogs\r\n    slaughtered for interstate trade, but this examination shall be\r\n    confined to those intended for the export trade._\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis heard of these things little by little, in the gossip of those\r\nwho were obliged to perpetrate them.",
        "It seemed as if every time you met\r\na person from a new department, you heard of new swindles and new\r\ncrimes.",
        "There was, for instance, a Lithuanian who was a cattle butcher\r\nfor the plant where Marija had worked, which killed meat for canning\r\nonly; and to hear this man describe the animals which came to his place\r\nwould have been worthwhile for a Dante or a Zola.",
        "It seemed that they\r\nmust have agencies all over the country, to hunt out old and crippled\r\nand diseased cattle to be canned.",
        "There were cattle which had been fed\r\non “whisky-malt,” the refuse of the breweries, and had become what the\r\nmen called “steerly”—which means covered with boils.",
        "It was a nasty job\r\nkilling these, for when you plunged your knife into them they would\r\nburst and splash foul-smelling stuff into your face; and when a man’s\r\nsleeves were smeared with blood, and his hands steeped in it, how was\r\nhe ever to wipe his face, or to clear his eyes so that he could see?",
        "It\r\nwas stuff such as this that made the “embalmed beef” that had killed\r\nseveral times as many United States soldiers as all the bullets of the\r\nSpaniards; only the army beef, besides, was not fresh canned, it was\r\nold stuff that had been lying for years in the cellars.",
        "Then one Sunday evening, Jurgis sat puffing his pipe by the kitchen\r\nstove, and talking with an old fellow whom Jonas had introduced, and\r\nwho worked in the canning rooms at Durham’s; and so Jurgis learned a\r\nfew things about the great and only Durham canned goods, which had\r\nbecome a national institution.",
        "They were regular alchemists at\r\nDurham’s; they advertised a mushroom-catsup, and the men who made it\r\ndid not know what a mushroom looked like.",
        "They advertised “potted\r\nchicken,”—and it was like the boardinghouse soup of the comic papers,\r\nthrough which a chicken had walked with rubbers on.",
        "Perhaps they had a\r\nsecret process for making chickens chemically—who knows?",
        "said Jurgis’\r\nfriend; the things that went into the mixture were tripe, and the fat\r\nof pork, and beef suet, and hearts of beef, and finally the waste ends\r\nof veal, when they had any.",
        "They put these up in several grades, and\r\nsold them at several prices; but the contents of the cans all came out\r\nof the same hopper.",
        "And then there was “potted game” and “potted\r\ngrouse,” “potted ham,” and “deviled ham”—de-vyled, as the men called\r\nit.",
        "“De-vyled” ham was made out of the waste ends of smoked beef that\r\nwere too small to be sliced by the machines; and also tripe, dyed with\r\nchemicals so that it would not show white; and trimmings of hams and\r\ncorned beef; and potatoes, skins and all; and finally the hard\r\ncartilaginous gullets of beef, after the tongues had been cut out.",
        "All\r\nthis ingenious mixture was ground up and flavored with spices to make\r\nit taste like something.",
        "Anybody who could invent a new imitation had\r\nbeen sure of a fortune from old Durham, said Jurgis’ informant; but it\r\nwas hard to think of anything new in a place where so many sharp wits\r\nhad been at work for so long; where men welcomed tuberculosis in the\r\ncattle they were feeding, because it made them fatten more quickly; and\r\nwhere they bought up all the old rancid butter left over in the grocery\r\nstores of a continent, and “oxidized” it by a forced-air process, to\r\ntake away the odor, rechurned it with skim milk, and sold it in bricks\r\nin the cities!",
        "Up to a year or two ago it had been the custom to kill\r\nhorses in the yards—ostensibly for fertilizer; but after long agitation\r\nthe newspapers had been able to make the public realize that the horses\r\nwere being canned.",
        "Now it was against the law to kill horses in\r\nPackingtown, and the law was really complied with—for the present, at\r\nany rate.",
        "Any day, however, one might see sharp-horned and\r\nshaggy-haired creatures running with the sheep and yet what a job you\r\nwould have to get the public to believe that a good part of what it\r\nbuys for lamb and mutton is really goat’s flesh!",
        "There was another interesting set of statistics that a person might\r\nhave gathered in Packingtown—those of the various afflictions of the\r\nworkers.",
        "When Jurgis had first inspected the packing plants with\r\nSzedvilas, he had marveled while he listened to the tale of all the\r\nthings that were made out of the carcasses of animals, and of all the\r\nlesser industries that were maintained there; now he found that each\r\none of these lesser industries was a separate little inferno, in its\r\nway as horrible as the killing beds, the source and fountain of them\r\nall.",
        "The workers in each of them had their own peculiar diseases.",
        "And\r\nthe wandering visitor might be skeptical about all the swindles, but he\r\ncould not be skeptical about these, for the worker bore the evidence of\r\nthem about on his own person—generally he had only to hold out his\r\nhand.",
        "There were the men in the pickle rooms, for instance, where old Antanas\r\nhad gotten his death; scarce a one of these that had not some spot of\r\nhorror on his person.",
        "Let a man so much as scrape his finger pushing a\r\ntruck in the pickle rooms, and he might have a sore that would put him\r\nout of the world; all the joints in his fingers might be eaten by the\r\nacid, one by one.",
        "Of the butchers and floorsmen, the beef-boners and\r\ntrimmers, and all those who used knives, you could scarcely find a\r\nperson who had the use of his thumb; time and time again the base of it\r\nhad been slashed, till it was a mere lump of flesh against which the\r\nman pressed the knife to hold it.",
        "The hands of these men would be\r\ncriss-crossed with cuts, until you could no longer pretend to count\r\nthem or to trace them.",
        "They would have no nails,—they had worn them off\r\npulling hides; their knuckles were swollen so that their fingers spread\r\nout like a fan.",
        "There were men who worked in the cooking rooms, in the\r\nmidst of steam and sickening odors, by artificial light; in these rooms\r\nthe germs of tuberculosis might live for two years, but the supply was\r\nrenewed every hour.",
        "There were the beef-luggers, who carried\r\ntwo-hundred-pound quarters into the refrigerator-cars; a fearful kind\r\nof work, that began at four o’clock in the morning, and that wore out\r\nthe most powerful men in a few years.",
        "There were those who worked in\r\nthe chilling rooms, and whose special disease was rheumatism; the time\r\nlimit that a man could work in the chilling rooms was said to be five\r\nyears.",
        "There were the wool-pluckers, whose hands went to pieces even\r\nsooner than the hands of the pickle men; for the pelts of the sheep had\r\nto be painted with acid to loosen the wool, and then the pluckers had\r\nto pull out this wool with their bare hands, till the acid had eaten\r\ntheir fingers off.",
        "There were those who made the tins for the canned\r\nmeat; and their hands, too, were a maze of cuts, and each cut\r\nrepresented a chance for blood poisoning.",
        "Some worked at the stamping\r\nmachines, and it was very seldom that one could work long there at the\r\npace that was set, and not give out and forget himself and have a part\r\nof his hand chopped off.",
        "There were the “hoisters,” as they were\r\ncalled, whose task it was to press the lever which lifted the dead\r\ncattle off the floor.",
        "They ran along upon a rafter, peering down\r\nthrough the damp and the steam; and as old Durham’s architects had not\r\nbuilt the killing room for the convenience of the hoisters, at every\r\nfew feet they would have to stoop under a beam, say four feet above the\r\none they ran on; which got them into the habit of stooping, so that in\r\na few years they would be walking like chimpanzees.",
        "Worst of any,\r\nhowever, were the fertilizer men, and those who served in the cooking\r\nrooms.",
        "These people could not be shown to the visitor,—for the odor of\r\na fertilizer man would scare any ordinary visitor at a hundred yards,\r\nand as for the other men, who worked in tank rooms full of steam, and\r\nin some of which there were open vats near the level of the floor,\r\ntheir peculiar trouble was that they fell into the vats; and when they\r\nwere fished out, there was never enough of them left to be worth\r\nexhibiting,—sometimes they would be overlooked for days, till all but\r\nthe bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham’s Pure Leaf Lard!",
        "CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the winter the family had had money enough to\r\nlive and a little over to pay their debts with; but when the earnings\r\nof Jurgis fell from nine or ten dollars a week to five or six, there\r\nwas no longer anything to spare.",
        "The winter went, and the spring came,\r\nand found them still living thus from hand to mouth, hanging on day by\r\nday, with literally not a month’s wages between them and starvation.",
        "Marija was in despair, for there was still no word about the reopening\r\nof the canning factory, and her savings were almost entirely gone.",
        "She\r\nhad had to give up all idea of marrying then; the family could not get\r\nalong without her—though for that matter she was likely soon to become\r\na burden even upon them, for when her money was all gone, they would\r\nhave to pay back what they owed her in board.",
        "So Jurgis and Ona and\r\nTeta Elzbieta would hold anxious conferences until late at night,\r\ntrying to figure how they could manage this too without starving.",
        "Such were the cruel terms upon which their life was possible, that they\r\nmight never have nor expect a single instant’s respite from worry, a\r\nsingle instant in which they were not haunted by the thought of money.",
        "They would no sooner escape, as by a miracle, from one difficulty, than\r\na new one would come into view.",
        "In addition to all their physical\r\nhardships, there was thus a constant strain upon their minds; they were\r\nharried all day and nearly all night by worry and fear.",
        "This was in\r\ntruth not living; it was scarcely even existing, and they felt that it\r\nwas too little for the price they paid.",
        "They were willing to work all\r\nthe time; and when people did their best, ought they not to be able to\r\nkeep alive?",
        "There seemed never to be an end to the things they had to buy and to\r\nthe unforeseen contingencies.",
        "Once their water pipes froze and burst;\r\nand when, in their ignorance, they thawed them out, they had a\r\nterrifying flood in their house.",
        "It happened while the men were away,\r\nand poor Elzbieta rushed out into the street screaming for help, for\r\nshe did not even know whether the flood could be stopped, or whether\r\nthey were ruined for life.",
        "It was nearly as bad as the latter, they\r\nfound in the end, for the plumber charged them seventy-five cents an\r\nhour, and seventy-five cents for another man who had stood and watched\r\nhim, and included all the time the two had been going and coming, and\r\nalso a charge for all sorts of material and extras.",
        "And then again,\r\nwhen they went to pay their January’s installment on the house, the\r\nagent terrified them by asking them if they had had the insurance\r\nattended to yet.",
        "In answer to their inquiry he showed them a clause in\r\nthe deed which provided that they were to keep the house insured for\r\none thousand dollars, as soon as the present policy ran out, which\r\nwould happen in a few days.",
        "Poor Elzbieta, upon whom again fell the\r\nblow, demanded how much it would cost them.",
        "Seven dollars, the man\r\nsaid; and that night came Jurgis, grim and determined, requesting that\r\nthe agent would be good enough to inform him, once for all, as to all\r\nthe expenses they were liable for.",
        "The deed was signed now, he said,\r\nwith sarcasm proper to the new way of life he had learned—the deed was\r\nsigned, and so the agent had no longer anything to gain by keeping\r\nquiet.",
        "And Jurgis looked the fellow squarely in the eye, and so the\r\nfellow wasted no time in conventional protests, but read him the deed.",
        "They would have to renew the insurance every year; they would have to\r\npay the taxes, about ten dollars a year; they would have to pay the\r\nwater tax, about six dollars a year—(Jurgis silently resolved to shut\r\noff the hydrant).",
        "This, besides the interest and the monthly\r\ninstallments, would be all—unless by chance the city should happen to\r\ndecide to put in a sewer or to lay a sidewalk.",
        "Yes, said the agent,\r\nthey would have to have these, whether they wanted them or not, if the\r\ncity said so.",
        "The sewer would cost them about twenty-two dollars, and\r\nthe sidewalk fifteen if it were wood, twenty-five if it were cement.",
        "So Jurgis went home again; it was a relief to know the worst, at any\r\nrate, so that he could no more be surprised by fresh demands.",
        "He saw\r\nnow how they had been plundered; but they were in for it, there was no\r\nturning back.",
        "They could only go on and make the fight and win—for\r\ndefeat was a thing that could not even be thought of.",
        "When the springtime came, they were delivered from the dreadful cold,\r\nand that was a great deal; but in addition they had counted on the\r\nmoney they would not have to pay for coal—and it was just at this time\r\nthat Marija’s board began to fail.",
        "Then, too, the warm weather brought\r\ntrials of its own; each season had its trials, as they found.",
        "In the\r\nspring there were cold rains, that turned the streets into canals and\r\nbogs; the mud would be so deep that wagons would sink up to the hubs,\r\nso that half a dozen horses could not move them.",
        "Then, of course, it\r\nwas impossible for any one to get to work with dry feet; and this was\r\nbad for men that were poorly clad and shod, and still worse for women\r\nand children.",
        "Later came midsummer, with the stifling heat, when the\r\ndingy killing beds of Durham’s became a very purgatory; one time, in a\r\nsingle day, three men fell dead from sunstroke.",
        "All day long the rivers\r\nof hot blood poured forth, until, with the sun beating down, and the\r\nair motionless, the stench was enough to knock a man over; all the old\r\nsmells of a generation would be drawn out by this heat—for there was\r\nnever any washing of the walls and rafters and pillars, and they were\r\ncaked with the filth of a lifetime.",
        "The men who worked on the killing\r\nbeds would come to reek with foulness, so that you could smell one of\r\nthem fifty feet away; there was simply no such thing as keeping decent,\r\nthe most careful man gave it up in the end, and wallowed in\r\nuncleanness.",
        "There was not even a place where a man could wash his\r\nhands, and the men ate as much raw blood as food at dinnertime.",
        "When\r\nthey were at work they could not even wipe off their faces—they were as\r\nhelpless as newly born babes in that respect; and it may seem like a\r\nsmall matter, but when the sweat began to run down their necks and\r\ntickle them, or a fly to bother them, it was a torture like being\r\nburned alive.",
        "Whether it was the slaughterhouses or the dumps that were\r\nresponsible, one could not say, but with the hot weather there\r\ndescended upon Packingtown a veritable Egyptian plague of flies; there\r\ncould be no describing this—the houses would be black with them.",
        "There\r\nwas no escaping; you might provide all your doors and windows with\r\nscreens, but their buzzing outside would be like the swarming of bees,\r\nand whenever you opened the door they would rush in as if a storm of\r\nwind were driving them.",
        "Perhaps the summertime suggests to you thoughts of the country, visions\r\nof green fields and mountains and sparkling lakes.",
        "It had no such\r\nsuggestion for the people in the yards.",
        "The great packing machine\r\nground on remorselessly, without thinking of green fields; and the men\r\nand women and children who were part of it never saw any green thing,\r\nnot even a flower.",
        "Four or five miles to the east of them lay the blue\r\nwaters of Lake Michigan; but for all the good it did them it might have\r\nbeen as far away as the Pacific Ocean.",
        "They had only Sundays, and then\r\nthey were too tired to walk.",
        "They were tied to the great packing\r\nmachine, and tied to it for life.",
        "The managers and superintendents and\r\nclerks of Packingtown were all recruited from another class, and never\r\nfrom the workers; they scorned the workers, the very meanest of them.",
        "A\r\npoor devil of a bookkeeper who had been working in Durham’s for twenty\r\nyears at a salary of six dollars a week, and might work there for\r\ntwenty more and do no better, would yet consider himself a gentleman,\r\nas far removed as the poles from the most skilled worker on the killing\r\nbeds; he would dress differently, and live in another part of the town,\r\nand come to work at a different hour of the day, and in every way make\r\nsure that he never rubbed elbows with a laboring man.",
        "Perhaps this was\r\ndue to the repulsiveness of the work; at any rate, the people who\r\nworked with their hands were a class apart, and were made to feel it.",
        "In the late spring the canning factory started up again, and so once\r\nmore Marija was heard to sing, and the love-music of Tamoszius took on\r\na less melancholy tone.",
        "It was not for long, however; for a month or\r\ntwo later a dreadful calamity fell upon Marija.",
        "Just one year and three\r\ndays after she had begun work as a can-painter, she lost her job.",
        "It was a long story.",
        "Marija insisted that it was because of her\r\nactivity in the union.",
        "The packers, of course, had spies in all the\r\nunions, and in addition they made a practice of buying up a certain\r\nnumber of the union officials, as many as they thought they needed.",
        "So\r\nevery week they received reports as to what was going on, and often\r\nthey knew things before the members of the union knew them.",
        "Any one who\r\nwas considered to be dangerous by them would find that he was not a\r\nfavorite with his boss; and Marija had been a great hand for going\r\nafter the foreign people and preaching to them.",
        "However that might be,\r\nthe known facts were that a few weeks before the factory closed, Marija\r\nhad been cheated out of her pay for three hundred cans.",
        "The girls\r\nworked at a long table, and behind them walked a woman with pencil and\r\nnotebook, keeping count of the number they finished.",
        "This woman was, of\r\ncourse, only human, and sometimes made mistakes; when this happened,\r\nthere was no redress—if on Saturday you got less money than you had\r\nearned, you had to make the best of it.",
        "But Marija did not understand\r\nthis, and made a disturbance.",
        "Marija’s disturbances did not mean\r\nanything, and while she had known only Lithuanian and Polish, they had\r\ndone no harm, for people only laughed at her and made her cry.",
        "But now\r\nMarija was able to call names in English, and so she got the woman who\r\nmade the mistake to disliking her.",
        "Probably, as Marija claimed, she\r\nmade mistakes on purpose after that; at any rate, she made them, and\r\nthe third time it happened Marija went on the warpath and took the\r\nmatter first to the forelady, and when she got no satisfaction there,\r\nto the superintendent.",
        "This was unheard-of presumption, but the\r\nsuperintendent said he would see about it, which Marija took to mean\r\nthat she was going to get her money; after waiting three days, she went\r\nto see the superintendent again.",
        "This time the man frowned, and said\r\nthat he had not had time to attend to it; and when Marija, against the\r\nadvice and warning of every one, tried it once more, he ordered her\r\nback to her work in a passion.",
        "Just how things happened after that\r\nMarija was not sure, but that afternoon the forelady told her that her\r\nservices would not be any longer required.",
        "Poor Marija could not have\r\nbeen more dumfounded had the woman knocked her over the head; at first\r\nshe could not believe what she heard, and then she grew furious and\r\nswore that she would come anyway, that her place belonged to her.",
        "In\r\nthe end she sat down in the middle of the floor and wept and wailed.",
        "It was a cruel lesson; but then Marija was headstrong—she should have\r\nlistened to those who had had experience.",
        "The next time she would know\r\nher place, as the forelady expressed it; and so Marija went out, and\r\nthe family faced the problem of an existence again.",
        "It was especially hard this time, for Ona was to be confined before\r\nlong, and Jurgis was trying hard to save up money for this.",
        "He had\r\nheard dreadful stories of the midwives, who grow as thick as fleas in\r\nPackingtown; and he had made up his mind that Ona must have a\r\nman-doctor.",
        "Jurgis could be very obstinate when he wanted to, and he\r\nwas in this case, much to the dismay of the women, who felt that a\r\nman-doctor was an impropriety, and that the matter really belonged to\r\nthem.",
        "The cheapest doctor they could find would charge them fifteen\r\ndollars, and perhaps more when the bill came in; and here was Jurgis,\r\ndeclaring that he would pay it, even if he had to stop eating in the\r\nmeantime!",
        "Marija had only about twenty-five dollars left.",
        "Day after day she\r\nwandered about the yards begging a job, but this time without hope of\r\nfinding it.",
        "Marija could do the work of an able-bodied man, when she\r\nwas cheerful, but discouragement wore her out easily, and she would\r\ncome home at night a pitiable object.",
        "She learned her lesson this time,\r\npoor creature; she learned it ten times over.",
        "All the family learned it\r\nalong with her—that when you have once got a job in Packingtown, you\r\nhang on to it, come what will.",
        "Four weeks Marija hunted, and half of a fifth week.",
        "Of course she\r\nstopped paying her dues to the union.",
        "She lost all interest in the\r\nunion, and cursed herself for a fool that she had ever been dragged\r\ninto one.",
        "She had about made up her mind that she was a lost soul, when\r\nsomebody told her of an opening, and she went and got a place as a\r\n“beef-trimmer.” She got this because the boss saw that she had the\r\nmuscles of a man, and so he discharged a man and put Marija to do his\r\nwork, paying her a little more than half what he had been paying\r\nbefore.",
        "When she first came to Packingtown, Marija would have scorned such work\r\nas this.",
        "She was in another canning factory, and her work was to trim\r\nthe meat of those diseased cattle that Jurgis had been told about not\r\nlong before.",
        "She was shut up in one of the rooms where the people\r\nseldom saw the daylight; beneath her were the chilling rooms, where the\r\nmeat was frozen, and above her were the cooking rooms; and so she stood\r\non an ice-cold floor, while her head was often so hot that she could\r\nscarcely breathe.",
        "Trimming beef off the bones by the hundred-weight,\r\nwhile standing up from early morning till late at night, with heavy\r\nboots on and the floor always damp and full of puddles, liable to be\r\nthrown out of work indefinitely because of a slackening in the trade,\r\nliable again to be kept overtime in rush seasons, and be worked till\r\nshe trembled in every nerve and lost her grip on her slimy knife, and\r\ngave herself a poisoned wound—that was the new life that unfolded\r\nitself before Marija.",
        "But because Marija was a human horse she merely\r\nlaughed and went at it; it would enable her to pay her board again, and\r\nkeep the family going.",
        "And as for Tamoszius—well, they had waited a\r\nlong time, and they could wait a little longer.",
        "They could not possibly\r\nget along upon his wages alone, and the family could not live without\r\nhers.",
        "He could come and visit her, and sit in the kitchen and hold her\r\nhand, and he must manage to be content with that.",
        "But day by day the\r\nmusic of Tamoszius’ violin became more passionate and heartbreaking;\r\nand Marija would sit with her hands clasped and her cheeks wet and all\r\nher body a-tremble, hearing in the wailing melodies the voices of the\r\nunborn generations which cried out in her for life.",
        "Marija’s lesson came just in time to save Ona from a similar fate.",
        "Ona,\r\ntoo, was dissatisfied with her place, and had far more reason than\r\nMarija.",
        "She did not tell half of her story at home, because she saw it\r\nwas a torment to Jurgis, and she was afraid of what he might do.",
        "For a\r\nlong time Ona had seen that Miss Henderson, the forelady in her\r\ndepartment, did not like her.",
        "At first she thought it was the old-time\r\nmistake she had made in asking for a holiday to get married.",
        "Then she\r\nconcluded it must be because she did not give the forelady a present\r\noccasionally—she was the kind that took presents from the girls, Ona\r\nlearned, and made all sorts of discriminations in favor of those who\r\ngave them.",
        "In the end, however, Ona discovered that it was even worse\r\nthan that.",
        "Miss Henderson was a newcomer, and it was some time before\r\nrumor made her out; but finally it transpired that she was a kept\r\nwoman, the former mistress of the superintendent of a department in the\r\nsame building.",
        "He had put her there to keep her quiet, it seemed—and\r\nthat not altogether with success, for once or twice they had been heard\r\nquarreling.",
        "She had the temper of a hyena, and soon the place she ran\r\nwas a witch’s caldron.",
        "There were some of the girls who were of her own\r\nsort, who were willing to toady to her and flatter her; and these would\r\ncarry tales about the rest, and so the furies were unchained in the\r\nplace.",
        "Worse than this, the woman lived in a bawdy-house downtown, with\r\na coarse, red-faced Irishman named Connor, who was the boss of the\r\nloading-gang outside, and would make free with the girls as they went\r\nto and from their work.",
        "In the slack seasons some of them would go with\r\nMiss Henderson to this house downtown—in fact, it would not be too much\r\nto say that she managed her department at Brown’s in conjunction with\r\nit.",
        "Sometimes women from the house would be given places alongside of\r\ndecent girls, and after other decent girls had been turned off to make\r\nroom for them.",
        "When you worked in this woman’s department the house\r\ndowntown was never out of your thoughts all day—there were always\r\nwhiffs of it to be caught, like the odor of the Packingtown rendering\r\nplants at night, when the wind shifted suddenly.",
        "There would be stories\r\nabout it going the rounds; the girls opposite you would be telling them\r\nand winking at you.",
        "In such a place Ona would not have stayed a day,\r\nbut for starvation; and, as it was, she was never sure that she could\r\nstay the next day.",
        "She understood now that the real reason that Miss\r\nHenderson hated her was that she was a decent married girl; and she\r\nknew that the talebearers and the toadies hated her for the same\r\nreason, and were doing their best to make her life miserable.",
        "But there was no place a girl could go in Packingtown, if she was\r\nparticular about things of this sort; there was no place in it where a\r\nprostitute could not get along better than a decent girl.",
        "Here was a\r\npopulation, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge\r\nof starvation, and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the\r\nwhim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave\r\ndrivers; under such circumstances immorality was exactly as inevitable,\r\nand as prevalent, as it was under the system of chattel slavery.",
        "Things\r\nthat were quite unspeakable went on there in the packing houses all the\r\ntime, and were taken for granted by everybody; only they did not show,\r\nas in the old slavery times, because there was no difference in color\r\nbetween master and slave.",
        "One morning Ona stayed home, and Jurgis had the man-doctor, according\r\nto his whim, and she was safely delivered of a fine baby.",
        "It was an\r\nenormous big boy, and Ona was such a tiny creature herself, that it\r\nseemed quite incredible.",
        "Jurgis would stand and gaze at the stranger by\r\nthe hour, unable to believe that it had really happened.",
        "The coming of this boy was a decisive event with Jurgis.",
        "It made him\r\nirrevocably a family man; it killed the last lingering impulse that he\r\nmight have had to go out in the evenings and sit and talk with the men\r\nin the saloons.",
        "There was nothing he cared for now so much as to sit\r\nand look at the baby.",
        "This was very curious, for Jurgis had never been\r\ninterested in babies before.",
        "But then, this was a very unusual sort of\r\na baby.",
        "He had the brightest little black eyes, and little black\r\nringlets all over his head; he was the living image of his father,\r\neverybody said—and Jurgis found this a fascinating circumstance.",
        "It was\r\nsufficiently perplexing that this tiny mite of life should have come\r\ninto the world at all in the manner that it had; that it should have\r\ncome with a comical imitation of its father’s nose was simply uncanny.",
        "Perhaps, Jurgis thought, this was intended to signify that it was his\r\nbaby; that it was his and Ona’s, to care for all its life.",
        "Jurgis had\r\nnever possessed anything nearly so interesting—a baby was, when you\r\ncame to think about it, assuredly a marvelous possession.",
        "It would grow\r\nup to be a man, a human soul, with a personality all its own, a will of\r\nits own!",
        "Such thoughts would keep haunting Jurgis, filling him with all\r\nsorts of strange and almost painful excitements.",
        "He was wonderfully\r\nproud of little Antanas; he was curious about all the details of\r\nhim—the washing and the dressing and the eating and the sleeping of\r\nhim, and asked all sorts of absurd questions.",
        "It took him quite a while\r\nto get over his alarm at the incredible shortness of the little\r\ncreature’s legs.",
        "Jurgis had, alas, very little time to see his baby; he never felt the\r\nchains about him more than just then.",
        "When he came home at night, the\r\nbaby would be asleep, and it would be the merest chance if he awoke\r\nbefore Jurgis had to go to sleep himself.",
        "Then in the morning there was\r\nno time to look at him, so really the only chance the father had was on\r\nSundays.",
        "This was more cruel yet for Ona, who ought to have stayed home\r\nand nursed him, the doctor said, for her own health as well as the\r\nbaby’s; but Ona had to go to work, and leave him for Teta Elzbieta to\r\nfeed upon the pale blue poison that was called milk at the corner\r\ngrocery.",
        "Ona’s confinement lost her only a week’s wages—she would go to\r\nthe factory the second Monday, and the best that Jurgis could persuade\r\nher was to ride in the car, and let him run along behind and help her\r\nto Brown’s when she alighted.",
        "After that it would be all right, said\r\nOna, it was no strain sitting still sewing hams all day; and if she\r\nwaited longer she might find that her dreadful forelady had put some\r\none else in her place.",
        "That would be a greater calamity than ever now,\r\nOna continued, on account of the baby.",
        "They would all have to work\r\nharder now on his account.",
        "It was such a responsibility—they must not\r\nhave the baby grow up to suffer as they had.",
        "And this indeed had been\r\nthe first thing that Jurgis had thought of himself—he had clenched his\r\nhands and braced himself anew for the struggle, for the sake of that\r\ntiny mite of human possibility.",
        "And so Ona went back to Brown’s and saved her place and a week’s wages;\r\nand so she gave herself some one of the thousand ailments that women\r\ngroup under the title of “womb trouble,” and was never again a well\r\nperson as long as she lived.",
        "It is difficult to convey in words all\r\nthat this meant to Ona; it seemed such a slight offense, and the\r\npunishment was so out of all proportion, that neither she nor any one\r\nelse ever connected the two.",
        "“Womb trouble” to Ona did not mean a\r\nspecialist’s diagnosis, and a course of treatment, and perhaps an\r\noperation or two; it meant simply headaches and pains in the back, and\r\ndepression and heartsickness, and neuralgia when she had to go to work\r\nin the rain.",
        "The great majority of the women who worked in Packingtown\r\nsuffered in the same way, and from the same cause, so it was not deemed\r\na thing to see the doctor about; instead Ona would try patent\r\nmedicines, one after another, as her friends told her about them.",
        "As\r\nthese all contained alcohol, or some other stimulant, she found that\r\nthey all did her good while she took them; and so she was always\r\nchasing the phantom of good health, and losing it because she was too\r\npoor to continue.",
        "CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the summer the packing houses were in full activity again, and\r\nJurgis made more money.",
        "He did not make so much, however, as he had the\r\nprevious summer, for the packers took on more hands.",
        "There were new men\r\nevery week, it seemed—it was a regular system; and this number they\r\nwould keep over to the next slack season, so that every one would have\r\nless than ever.",
        "Sooner or later, by this plan, they would have all the\r\nfloating labor of Chicago trained to do their work.",
        "And how very\r\ncunning a trick was that!",
        "The men were to teach new hands, who would\r\nsome day come and break their strike; and meantime they were kept so\r\npoor that they could not prepare for the trial!",
        "But let no one suppose that this superfluity of employees meant easier\r\nwork for any one!",
        "On the contrary, the speeding-up seemed to be growing\r\nmore savage all the time; they were continually inventing new devices\r\nto crowd the work on—it was for all the world like the thumbscrew of\r\nthe mediæval torture chamber.",
        "They would get new pacemakers and pay\r\nthem more; they would drive the men on with new machinery—it was said\r\nthat in the hog-killing rooms the speed at which the hogs moved was\r\ndetermined by clockwork, and that it was increased a little every day.",
        "In piecework they would reduce the time, requiring the same work in a\r\nshorter time, and paying the same wages; and then, after the workers\r\nhad accustomed themselves to this new speed, they would reduce the rate\r\nof payment to correspond with the reduction in time!",
        "They had done this\r\nso often in the canning establishments that the girls were fairly\r\ndesperate; their wages had gone down by a full third in the past two\r\nyears, and a storm of discontent was brewing that was likely to break\r\nany day.",
        "Only a month after Marija had become a beef-trimmer the\r\ncanning factory that she had left posted a cut that would divide the\r\ngirls’ earnings almost squarely in half; and so great was the\r\nindignation at this that they marched out without even a parley, and\r\norganized in the street outside.",
        "One of the girls had read somewhere\r\nthat a red flag was the proper symbol for oppressed workers, and so\r\nthey mounted one, and paraded all about the yards, yelling with rage.",
        "A\r\nnew union was the result of this outburst, but the impromptu strike\r\nwent to pieces in three days, owing to the rush of new labor.",
        "At the\r\nend of it the girl who had carried the red flag went downtown and got a\r\nposition in a great department store, at a salary of two dollars and a\r\nhalf a week.",
        "Jurgis and Ona heard these stories with dismay, for there was no\r\ntelling when their own time might come.",
        "Once or twice there had been\r\nrumors that one of the big houses was going to cut its unskilled men to\r\nfifteen cents an hour, and Jurgis knew that if this was done, his turn\r\nwould come soon.",
        "He had learned by this time that Packingtown was\r\nreally not a number of firms at all, but one great firm, the Beef\r\nTrust.",
        "And every week the managers of it got together and compared\r\nnotes, and there was one scale for all the workers in the yards and one\r\nstandard of efficiency.",
        "Jurgis was told that they also fixed the price\r\nthey would pay for beef on the hoof and the price of all dressed meat\r\nin the country; but that was something he did not understand or care\r\nabout.",
        "The only one who was not afraid of a cut was Marija, who congratulated\r\nherself, somewhat naïvely, that there had been one in her place only a\r\nshort time before she came.",
        "Marija was getting to be a skilled\r\nbeef-trimmer, and was mounting to the heights again.",
        "During the summer\r\nand fall Jurgis and Ona managed to pay her back the last penny they\r\nowed her, and so she began to have a bank account.",
        "Tamoszius had a bank\r\naccount also, and they ran a race, and began to figure upon household\r\nexpenses once more.",
        "The possession of vast wealth entails cares and responsibilities,\r\nhowever, as poor Marija found out.",
        "She had taken the advice of a friend\r\nand invested her savings in a bank on Ashland Avenue.",
        "Of course she\r\nknew nothing about it, except that it was big and imposing—what\r\npossible chance has a poor foreign working girl to understand the\r\nbanking business, as it is conducted in this land of frenzied finance?",
        "So Marija lived in a continual dread lest something should happen to\r\nher bank, and would go out of her way mornings to make sure that it was\r\nstill there.",
        "Her principal thought was of fire, for she had deposited\r\nher money in bills, and was afraid that if they were burned up the bank\r\nwould not give her any others.",
        "Jurgis made fun of her for this, for he\r\nwas a man and was proud of his superior knowledge, telling her that the\r\nbank had fireproof vaults, and all its millions of dollars hidden\r\nsafely away in them.",
        "However, one morning Marija took her usual detour, and, to her horror\r\nand dismay, saw a crowd of people in front of the bank, filling the\r\navenue solid for half a block.",
        "All the blood went out of her face for\r\nterror.",
        "She broke into a run, shouting to the people to ask what was\r\nthe matter, but not stopping to hear what they answered, till she had\r\ncome to where the throng was so dense that she could no longer advance.",
        "There was a “run on the bank,” they told her then, but she did not know\r\nwhat that was, and turned from one person to another, trying in an\r\nagony of fear to make out what they meant.",
        "Had something gone wrong\r\nwith the bank?",
        "Nobody was sure, but they thought so.",
        "Couldn’t she get\r\nher money?",
        "There was no telling; the people were afraid not, and they\r\nwere all trying to get it.",
        "It was too early yet to tell anything—the\r\nbank would not open for nearly three hours.",
        "So in a frenzy of despair\r\nMarija began to claw her way toward the doors of this building, through\r\na throng of men, women, and children, all as excited as herself.",
        "It was\r\na scene of wild confusion, women shrieking and wringing their hands and\r\nfainting, and men fighting and trampling down everything in their way.",
        "In the midst of the mêlée Marija recollected that she did not have her\r\nbankbook, and could not get her money anyway, so she fought her way out\r\nand started on a run for home.",
        "This was fortunate for her, for a few\r\nminutes later the police reserves arrived.",
        "In half an hour Marija was back, Teta Elzbieta with her, both of them\r\nbreathless with running and sick with fear.",
        "The crowd was now formed in\r\na line, extending for several blocks, with half a hundred policemen\r\nkeeping guard, and so there was nothing for them to do but to take\r\ntheir places at the end of it.",
        "At nine o’clock the bank opened and\r\nbegan to pay the waiting throng; but then, what good did that do\r\nMarija, who saw three thousand people before her—enough to take out the\r\nlast penny of a dozen banks?",
        "To make matters worse a drizzling rain came up, and soaked them to the\r\nskin; yet all the morning they stood there, creeping slowly toward the\r\ngoal—all the afternoon they stood there, heartsick, seeing that the\r\nhour of closing was coming, and that they were going to be left out.",
        "Marija made up her mind that, come what might, she would stay there and\r\nkeep her place; but as nearly all did the same, all through the long,\r\ncold night, she got very little closer to the bank for that.",
        "Toward\r\nevening Jurgis came; he had heard the story from the children, and he\r\nbrought some food and dry wraps, which made it a little easier.",
        "The next morning, before daybreak, came a bigger crowd than ever, and\r\nmore policemen from downtown.",
        "Marija held on like grim death, and\r\ntoward afternoon she got into the bank and got her money—all in big\r\nsilver dollars, a handkerchief full.",
        "When she had once got her hands on\r\nthem her fear vanished, and she wanted to put them back again; but the\r\nman at the window was savage, and said that the bank would receive no\r\nmore deposits from those who had taken part in the run.",
        "So Marija was\r\nforced to take her dollars home with her, watching to right and left,\r\nexpecting every instant that some one would try to rob her; and when\r\nshe got home she was not much better off.",
        "Until she could find another\r\nbank there was nothing to do but sew them up in her clothes, and so\r\nMarija went about for a week or more, loaded down with bullion, and\r\nafraid to cross the street in front of the house, because Jurgis told\r\nher she would sink out of sight in the mud.",
        "Weighted this way she made\r\nher way to the yards, again in fear, this time to see if she had lost\r\nher place; but fortunately about ten per cent of the working people of\r\nPackingtown had been depositors in that bank, and it was not convenient\r\nto discharge that many at once.",
        "The cause of the panic had been the\r\nattempt of a policeman to arrest a drunken man in a saloon next door,\r\nwhich had drawn a crowd at the hour the people were on their way to\r\nwork, and so started the “run.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time Jurgis and Ona also began a bank account.",
        "Besides\r\nhaving paid Jonas and Marija, they had almost paid for their furniture,\r\nand could have that little sum to count on.",
        "So long as each of them\r\ncould bring home nine or ten dollars a week, they were able to get\r\nalong finely.",
        "Also election day came round again, and Jurgis made half\r\na week’s wages out of that, all net profit.",
        "It was a very close\r\nelection that year, and the echoes of the battle reached even to\r\nPackingtown.",
        "The two rival sets of grafters hired halls and set off\r\nfireworks and made speeches, to try to get the people interested in the\r\nmatter.",
        "Although Jurgis did not understand it all, he knew enough by\r\nthis time to realize that it was not supposed to be right to sell your\r\nvote.",
        "However, as every one did it, and his refusal to join would not\r\nhave made the slightest difference in the results, the idea of refusing\r\nwould have seemed absurd, had it ever come into his head.",
        "Now chill winds and shortening days began to warn them that the winter\r\nwas coming again.",
        "It seemed as if the respite had been too short—they\r\nhad not had time enough to get ready for it; but still it came,\r\ninexorably, and the hunted look began to come back into the eyes of\r\nlittle Stanislovas.",
        "The prospect struck fear to the heart of Jurgis\r\nalso, for he knew that Ona was not fit to face the cold and the\r\nsnowdrifts this year.",
        "And suppose that some day when a blizzard struck\r\nthem and the cars were not running, Ona should have to give up, and\r\nshould come the next day to find that her place had been given to some\r\none who lived nearer and could be depended on?",
        "It was the week before Christmas that the first storm came, and then\r\nthe soul of Jurgis rose up within him like a sleeping lion.",
        "There were\r\nfour days that the Ashland Avenue cars were stalled, and in those days,\r\nfor the first time in his life, Jurgis knew what it was to be really\r\nopposed.",
        "He had faced difficulties before, but they had been child’s\r\nplay; now there was a death struggle, and all the furies were unchained\r\nwithin him.",
        "The first morning they set out two hours before dawn, Ona\r\nwrapped all in blankets and tossed upon his shoulder like a sack of\r\nmeal, and the little boy, bundled nearly out of sight, hanging by his\r\ncoat-tails.",
        "There was a raging blast beating in his face, and the\r\nthermometer stood below zero; the snow was never short of his knees,\r\nand in some of the drifts it was nearly up to his armpits.",
        "It would\r\ncatch his feet and try to trip him; it would build itself into a wall\r\nbefore him to beat him back; and he would fling himself into it,\r\nplunging like a wounded buffalo, puffing and snorting in rage.",
        "So foot\r\nby foot he drove his way, and when at last he came to Durham’s he was\r\nstaggering and almost blind, and leaned against a pillar, gasping, and\r\nthanking God that the cattle came late to the killing beds that day.",
        "In\r\nthe evening the same thing had to be done again; and because Jurgis\r\ncould not tell what hour of the night he would get off, he got a\r\nsaloon-keeper to let Ona sit and wait for him in a corner.",
        "Once it was\r\neleven o’clock at night, and black as the pit, but still they got home.",
        "That blizzard knocked many a man out, for the crowd outside begging for\r\nwork was never greater, and the packers would not wait long for any\r\none.",
        "When it was over, the soul of Jurgis was a song, for he had met\r\nthe enemy and conquered, and felt himself the master of his fate.—So it\r\nmight be with some monarch of the forest that has vanquished his foes\r\nin fair fight, and then falls into some cowardly trap in the\r\nnight-time.",
        "A time of peril on the killing beds was when a steer broke loose.",
        "Sometimes, in the haste of speeding-up, they would dump one of the\r\nanimals out on the floor before it was fully stunned, and it would get\r\nupon its feet and run amuck.",
        "Then there would be a yell of warning—the\r\nmen would drop everything and dash for the nearest pillar, slipping\r\nhere and there on the floor, and tumbling over each other.",
        "This was bad\r\nenough in the summer, when a man could see; in wintertime it was enough\r\nto make your hair stand up, for the room would be so full of steam that\r\nyou could not make anything out five feet in front of you.",
        "To be sure,\r\nthe steer was generally blind and frantic, and not especially bent on\r\nhurting any one; but think of the chances of running upon a knife,\r\nwhile nearly every man had one in his hand!",
        "And then, to cap the\r\nclimax, the floor boss would come rushing up with a rifle and begin\r\nblazing away!",
        "It was in one of these mêlées that Jurgis fell into his trap.",
        "That is\r\nthe only word to describe it; it was so cruel, and so utterly not to be\r\nforeseen.",
        "At first he hardly noticed it, it was such a slight\r\naccident—simply that in leaping out of the way he turned his ankle.",
        "There was a twinge of pain, but Jurgis was used to pain, and did not\r\ncoddle himself.",
        "When he came to walk home, however, he realized that it\r\nwas hurting him a great deal; and in the morning his ankle was swollen\r\nout nearly double its size, and he could not get his foot into his\r\nshoe.",
        "Still, even then, he did nothing more than swear a little, and\r\nwrapped his foot in old rags, and hobbled out to take the car.",
        "It\r\nchanced to be a rush day at Durham’s, and all the long morning he\r\nlimped about with his aching foot; by noontime the pain was so great\r\nthat it made him faint, and after a couple of hours in the afternoon he\r\nwas fairly beaten, and had to tell the boss.",
        "They sent for the company\r\ndoctor, and he examined the foot and told Jurgis to go home to bed,\r\nadding that he had probably laid himself up for months by his folly.",
        "The injury was not one that Durham and Company could be held\r\nresponsible for, and so that was all there was to it, so far as the\r\ndoctor was concerned.",
        "Jurgis got home somehow, scarcely able to see for the pain, and with an\r\nawful terror in his soul, Elzbieta helped him into bed and bandaged his\r\ninjured foot with cold water and tried hard not to let him see her\r\ndismay; when the rest came home at night she met them outside and told\r\nthem, and they, too, put on a cheerful face, saying it would only be\r\nfor a week or two, and that they would pull him through.",
        "When they had gotten him to sleep, however, they sat by the kitchen\r\nfire and talked it over in frightened whispers.",
        "They were in for a\r\nsiege, that was plainly to be seen.",
        "Jurgis had only about sixty dollars\r\nin the bank, and the slack season was upon them.",
        "Both Jonas and Marija\r\nmight soon be earning no more than enough to pay their board, and\r\nbesides that there were only the wages of Ona and the pittance of the\r\nlittle boy.",
        "There was the rent to pay, and still some on the furniture;\r\nthere was the insurance just due, and every month there was sack after\r\nsack of coal.",
        "It was January, midwinter, an awful time to have to face\r\nprivation.",
        "Deep snows would come again, and who would carry Ona to her\r\nwork now?",
        "She might lose her place—she was almost certain to lose it.",
        "And then little Stanislovas began to whimper—who would take care of\r\nhim?",
        "It was dreadful that an accident of this sort, that no man can help,\r\nshould have meant such suffering.",
        "The bitterness of it was the daily\r\nfood and drink of Jurgis.",
        "It was of no use for them to try to deceive\r\nhim; he knew as much about the situation as they did, and he knew that\r\nthe family might literally starve to death.",
        "The worry of it fairly ate\r\nhim up—he began to look haggard the first two or three days of it.",
        "In\r\ntruth, it was almost maddening for a strong man like him, a fighter, to\r\nhave to lie there helpless on his back.",
        "It was for all the world the\r\nold story of Prometheus bound.",
        "As Jurgis lay on his bed, hour after\r\nhour there came to him emotions that he had never known before.",
        "Before\r\nthis he had met life with a welcome—it had its trials, but none that a\r\nman could not face.",
        "But now, in the nighttime, when he lay tossing\r\nabout, there would come stalking into his chamber a grisly phantom, the\r\nsight of which made his flesh curl and his hair to bristle up.",
        "It was\r\nlike seeing the world fall away from underneath his feet; like plunging\r\ndown into a bottomless abyss into yawning caverns of despair.",
        "It might\r\nbe true, then, after all, what others had told him about life, that the\r\nbest powers of a man might not be equal to it!",
        "It might be true that,\r\nstrive as he would, toil as he would, he might fail, and go down and be\r\ndestroyed!",
        "The thought of this was like an icy hand at his heart; the\r\nthought that here, in this ghastly home of all horror, he and all those\r\nwho were dear to him might lie and perish of starvation and cold, and\r\nthere would be no ear to hear their cry, no hand to help them!",
        "It was\r\ntrue, it was true,—that here in this huge city, with its stores of\r\nheaped-up wealth, human creatures might be hunted down and destroyed by\r\nthe wild-beast powers of nature, just as truly as ever they were in the\r\ndays of the cave men!",
        "Ona was now making about thirty dollars a month, and Stanislovas about\r\nthirteen.",
        "To add to this there was the board of Jonas and Marija, about\r\nforty-five dollars.",
        "Deducting from this the rent, interest, and\r\ninstallments on the furniture, they had left sixty dollars, and\r\ndeducting the coal, they had fifty.",
        "They did without everything that\r\nhuman beings could do without; they went in old and ragged clothing,\r\nthat left them at the mercy of the cold, and when the children’s shoes\r\nwore out, they tied them up with string.",
        "Half invalid as she was, Ona\r\nwould do herself harm by walking in the rain and cold when she ought to\r\nhave ridden; they bought literally nothing but food—and still they\r\ncould not keep alive on fifty dollars a month.",
        "They might have done it,\r\nif only they could have gotten pure food, and at fair prices; or if\r\nonly they had known what to get—if they had not been so pitifully\r\nignorant!",
        "But they had come to a new country, where everything was\r\ndifferent, including the food.",
        "They had always been accustomed to eat a\r\ngreat deal of smoked sausage, and how could they know that what they\r\nbought in America was not the same—that its color was made by\r\nchemicals, and its smoky flavor by more chemicals, and that it was full\r\nof “potato flour” besides?",
        "Potato flour is the waste of potato after\r\nthe starch and alcohol have been extracted; it has no more food value\r\nthan so much wood, and as its use as a food adulterant is a penal\r\noffense in Europe, thousands of tons of it are shipped to America every\r\nyear.",
        "It was amazing what quantities of food such as this were needed\r\nevery day, by eleven hungry persons.",
        "A dollar sixty-five a day was\r\nsimply not enough to feed them, and there was no use trying; and so\r\neach week they made an inroad upon the pitiful little bank account that\r\nOna had begun.",
        "Because the account was in her name, it was possible for\r\nher to keep this a secret from her husband, and to keep the\r\nheartsickness of it for her own.",
        "It would have been better if Jurgis had been really ill; if he had not\r\nbeen able to think.",
        "For he had no resources such as most invalids have;\r\nall he could do was to lie there and toss about from side to side.",
        "Now\r\nand then he would break into cursing, regardless of everything; and now\r\nand then his impatience would get the better of him, and he would try\r\nto get up, and poor Teta Elzbieta would have to plead with him in a\r\nfrenzy.",
        "Elzbieta was all alone with him the greater part of the time.",
        "She would sit and smooth his forehead by the hour, and talk to him and\r\ntry to make him forget.",
        "Sometimes it would be too cold for the children\r\nto go to school, and they would have to play in the kitchen, where\r\nJurgis was, because it was the only room that was half warm.",
        "These were\r\ndreadful times, for Jurgis would get as cross as any bear; he was\r\nscarcely to be blamed, for he had enough to worry him, and it was hard\r\nwhen he was trying to take a nap to be kept awake by noisy and peevish\r\nchildren.",
        "Elzbieta’s only resource in those times was little Antanas; indeed, it\r\nwould be hard to say how they could have gotten along at all if it had\r\nnot been for little Antanas.",
        "It was the one consolation of Jurgis’ long\r\nimprisonment that now he had time to look at his baby.",
        "Teta Elzbieta\r\nwould put the clothes-basket in which the baby slept alongside of his\r\nmattress, and Jurgis would lie upon one elbow and watch him by the\r\nhour, imagining things.",
        "Then little Antanas would open his eyes—he was\r\nbeginning to take notice of things now; and he would smile—how he would\r\nsmile!",
        "So Jurgis would begin to forget and be happy because he was in a\r\nworld where there was a thing so beautiful as the smile of little\r\nAntanas, and because such a world could not but be good at the heart of\r\nit.",
        "He looked more like his father every hour, Elzbieta would say, and\r\nsaid it many times a day, because she saw that it pleased Jurgis; the\r\npoor little terror-stricken woman was planning all day and all night to\r\nsoothe the prisoned giant who was intrusted to her care.",
        "Jurgis, who\r\nknew nothing about the age-long and everlasting hypocrisy of woman,\r\nwould take the bait and grin with delight; and then he would hold his\r\nfinger in front of little Antanas’ eyes, and move it this way and that,\r\nand laugh with glee to see the baby follow it.",
        "There is no pet quite so\r\nfascinating as a baby; he would look into Jurgis’ face with such\r\nuncanny seriousness, and Jurgis would start and cry: “_Palauk!_ Look,\r\nMuma, he knows his papa!",
        "He does, he does!",
        "_Tu mano szirdele_, the\r\nlittle rascal!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nFor three weeks after his injury Jurgis never got up from bed.",
        "It was a\r\nvery obstinate sprain; the swelling would not go down, and the pain\r\nstill continued.",
        "At the end of that time, however, he could contain\r\nhimself no longer, and began trying to walk a little every day,\r\nlaboring to persuade himself that he was better.",
        "No arguments could\r\nstop him, and three or four days later he declared that he was going\r\nback to work.",
        "He limped to the cars and got to Brown’s, where he found\r\nthat the boss had kept his place—that is, was willing to turn out into\r\nthe snow the poor devil he had hired in the meantime.",
        "Every now and\r\nthen the pain would force Jurgis to stop work, but he stuck it out till\r\nnearly an hour before closing.",
        "Then he was forced to acknowledge that\r\nhe could not go on without fainting; it almost broke his heart to do\r\nit, and he stood leaning against a pillar and weeping like a child.",
        "Two\r\nof the men had to help him to the car, and when he got out he had to\r\nsit down and wait in the snow till some one came along.",
        "So they put him to bed again, and sent for the doctor, as they ought to\r\nhave done in the beginning.",
        "It transpired that he had twisted a tendon\r\nout of place, and could never have gotten well without attention.",
        "Then\r\nhe gripped the sides of the bed, and shut his teeth together, and\r\nturned white with agony, while the doctor pulled and wrenched away at\r\nhis swollen ankle.",
        "When finally the doctor left, he told him that he\r\nwould have to lie quiet for two months, and that if he went to work\r\nbefore that time he might lame himself for life.",
        "Three days later there came another heavy snowstorm, and Jonas and\r\nMarija and Ona and little Stanislovas all set out together, an hour\r\nbefore daybreak, to try to get to the yards.",
        "About noon the last two\r\ncame back, the boy screaming with pain.",
        "His fingers were all frosted,\r\nit seemed.",
        "They had had to give up trying to get to the yards, and had\r\nnearly perished in a drift.",
        "All that they knew how to do was to hold\r\nthe frozen fingers near the fire, and so little Stanislovas spent most\r\nof the day dancing about in horrible agony, till Jurgis flew into a\r\npassion of nervous rage and swore like a madman, declaring that he\r\nwould kill him if he did not stop.",
        "All that day and night the family\r\nwas half-crazed with fear that Ona and the boy had lost their places;\r\nand in the morning they set out earlier than ever, after the little\r\nfellow had been beaten with a stick by Jurgis.",
        "There could be no\r\ntrifling in a case like this, it was a matter of life and death; little\r\nStanislovas could not be expected to realize that he might a great deal\r\nbetter freeze in the snowdrift than lose his job at the lard machine.",
        "Ona was quite certain that she would find her place gone, and was all\r\nunnerved when she finally got to Brown’s, and found that the forelady\r\nherself had failed to come, and was therefore compelled to be lenient.",
        "One of the consequences of this episode was that the first joints of\r\nthree of the little boy’s fingers were permanently disabled, and\r\nanother that thereafter he always had to be beaten before he set out to\r\nwork, whenever there was fresh snow on the ground.",
        "Jurgis was called\r\nupon to do the beating, and as it hurt his foot he did it with a\r\nvengeance; but it did not tend to add to the sweetness of his temper.",
        "They say that the best dog will turn cross if he be kept chained all\r\nthe time, and it was the same with the man; he had not a thing to do\r\nall day but lie and curse his fate, and the time came when he wanted to\r\ncurse everything.",
        "This was never for very long, however, for when Ona began to cry,\r\nJurgis could not stay angry.",
        "The poor fellow looked like a homeless\r\nghost, with his cheeks sunken in and his long black hair straggling\r\ninto his eyes; he was too discouraged to cut it, or to think about his\r\nappearance.",
        "His muscles were wasting away, and what were left were soft\r\nand flabby.",
        "He had no appetite, and they could not afford to tempt him\r\nwith delicacies.",
        "It was better, he said, that he should not eat, it was\r\na saving.",
        "About the end of March he had got hold of Ona’s bankbook, and\r\nlearned that there was only three dollars left to them in the world.",
        "But perhaps the worst of the consequences of this long siege was that\r\nthey lost another member of their family; Brother Jonas disappeared.",
        "One Saturday night he did not come home, and thereafter all their\r\nefforts to get trace of him were futile.",
        "It was said by the boss at\r\nDurham’s that he had gotten his week’s money and left there.",
        "That might\r\nnot be true, of course, for sometimes they would say that when a man\r\nhad been killed; it was the easiest way out of it for all concerned.",
        "When, for instance, a man had fallen into one of the rendering tanks\r\nand had been made into pure leaf lard and peerless fertilizer, there\r\nwas no use letting the fact out and making his family unhappy.",
        "More\r\nprobable, however, was the theory that Jonas had deserted them, and\r\ngone on the road, seeking happiness.",
        "He had been discontented for a\r\nlong time, and not without some cause.",
        "He paid good board, and was yet\r\nobliged to live in a family where nobody had enough to eat.",
        "And Marija\r\nwould keep giving them all her money, and of course he could not but\r\nfeel that he was called upon to do the same.",
        "Then there were crying\r\nbrats, and all sorts of misery; a man would have had to be a good deal\r\nof a hero to stand it all without grumbling, and Jonas was not in the\r\nleast a hero—he was simply a weatherbeaten old fellow who liked to have\r\na good supper and sit in the corner by the fire and smoke his pipe in\r\npeace before he went to bed.",
        "Here there was not room by the fire, and\r\nthrough the winter the kitchen had seldom been warm enough for comfort.",
        "So, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea\r\nof escaping had come to him?",
        "Two years he had been yoked like a horse\r\nto a half-ton truck in Durham’s dark cellars, with never a rest, save\r\non Sundays and four holidays in the year, and with never a word of\r\nthanks—only kicks and blows and curses, such as no decent dog would\r\nhave stood.",
        "And now the winter was over, and the spring winds were\r\nblowing—and with a day’s walk a man might put the smoke of Packingtown\r\nbehind him forever, and be where the grass was green and the flowers\r\nall the colors of the rainbow!",
        "But now the income of the family was cut down more than one-third, and\r\nthe food demand was cut only one-eleventh, so that they were worse off\r\nthan ever.",
        "Also they were borrowing money from Marija, and eating up\r\nher bank account, and spoiling once again her hopes of marriage and\r\nhappiness.",
        "And they were even going into debt to Tamoszius Kuszleika\r\nand letting him impoverish himself.",
        "Poor Tamoszius was a man without\r\nany relatives, and with a wonderful talent besides, and he ought to\r\nhave made money and prospered; but he had fallen in love, and so given\r\nhostages to fortune, and was doomed to be dragged down too.",
        "So it was finally decided that two more of the children would have to\r\nleave school.",
        "Next to Stanislovas, who was now fifteen, there was a\r\ngirl, little Kotrina, who was two years younger, and then two boys,\r\nVilimas, who was eleven, and Nikalojus, who was ten.",
        "Both of these last\r\nwere bright boys, and there was no reason why their family should\r\nstarve when tens of thousands of children no older were earning their\r\nown livings.",
        "So one morning they were given a quarter apiece and a roll\r\nwith a sausage in it, and, with their minds top-heavy with good advice,\r\nwere sent out to make their way to the city and learn to sell\r\nnewspapers.",
        "They came back late at night in tears, having walked for\r\nthe five or six miles to report that a man had offered to take them to\r\na place where they sold newspapers, and had taken their money and gone\r\ninto a store to get them, and nevermore been seen.",
        "So they both\r\nreceived a whipping, and the next morning set out again.",
        "This time they\r\nfound the newspaper place, and procured their stock; and after\r\nwandering about till nearly noontime, saying “Paper?” to every one they\r\nsaw, they had all their stock taken away and received a thrashing\r\nbesides from a big newsman upon whose territory they had trespassed.",
        "Fortunately, however, they had already sold some papers, and came back\r\nwith nearly as much as they started with.",
        "After a week of mishaps such as these, the two little fellows began to\r\nlearn the ways of the trade—the names of the different papers, and how\r\nmany of each to get, and what sort of people to offer them to, and\r\nwhere to go and where to stay away from.",
        "After this, leaving home at\r\nfour o’clock in the morning, and running about the streets, first with\r\nmorning papers and then with evening, they might come home late at\r\nnight with twenty or thirty cents apiece—possibly as much as forty\r\ncents.",
        "From this they had to deduct their carfare, since the distance\r\nwas so great; but after a while they made friends, and learned still\r\nmore, and then they would save their carfare.",
        "They would get on a car\r\nwhen the conductor was not looking, and hide in the crowd; and three\r\ntimes out of four he would not ask for their fares, either not seeing\r\nthem, or thinking they had already paid; or if he did ask, they would\r\nhunt through their pockets, and then begin to cry, and either have\r\ntheir fares paid by some kind old lady, or else try the trick again on\r\na new car.",
        "All this was fair play, they felt.",
        "Whose fault was it that\r\nat the hours when workingmen were going to their work and back, the\r\ncars were so crowded that the conductors could not collect all the\r\nfares?",
        "And besides, the companies were thieves, people said—had stolen\r\nall their franchises with the help of scoundrelly politicians!",
        "Now that the winter was by, and there was no more danger of snow, and\r\nno more coal to buy, and another room warm enough to put the children\r\ninto when they cried, and enough money to get along from week to week\r\nwith, Jurgis was less terrible than he had been.",
        "A man can get used to\r\nanything in the course of time, and Jurgis had gotten used to lying\r\nabout the house.",
        "Ona saw this, and was very careful not to destroy his\r\npeace of mind, by letting him know how very much pain she was\r\nsuffering.",
        "It was now the time of the spring rains, and Ona had often\r\nto ride to her work, in spite of the expense; she was getting paler\r\nevery day, and sometimes, in spite of her good resolutions, it pained\r\nher that Jurgis did not notice it.",
        "She wondered if he cared for her as\r\nmuch as ever, if all this misery was not wearing out his love.",
        "She had\r\nto be away from him all the time, and bear her own troubles while he\r\nwas bearing his; and then, when she came home, she was so worn out; and\r\nwhenever they talked they had only their worries to talk of—truly it\r\nwas hard, in such a life, to keep any sentiment alive.",
        "The woe of this\r\nwould flame up in Ona sometimes—at night she would suddenly clasp her\r\nbig husband in her arms and break into passionate weeping, demanding to\r\nknow if he really loved her.",
        "Poor Jurgis, who had in truth grown more\r\nmatter-of-fact, under the endless pressure of penury, would not know\r\nwhat to make of these things, and could only try to recollect when he\r\nhad last been cross; and so Ona would have to forgive him and sob\r\nherself to sleep.",
        "The latter part of April Jurgis went to see the doctor, and was given a\r\nbandage to lace about his ankle, and told that he might go back to\r\nwork.",
        "It needed more than the permission of the doctor, however, for\r\nwhen he showed up on the killing floor of Brown’s, he was told by the\r\nforeman that it had not been possible to keep his job for him.",
        "Jurgis\r\nknew that this meant simply that the foreman had found some one else to\r\ndo the work as well and did not want to bother to make a change.",
        "He\r\nstood in the doorway, looking mournfully on, seeing his friends and\r\ncompanions at work, and feeling like an outcast.",
        "Then he went out and\r\ntook his place with the mob of the unemployed.",
        "This time, however, Jurgis did not have the same fine confidence, nor\r\nthe same reason for it.",
        "He was no longer the finest-looking man in the\r\nthrong, and the bosses no longer made for him; he was thin and haggard,\r\nand his clothes were seedy, and he looked miserable.",
        "And there were\r\nhundreds who looked and felt just like him, and who had been wandering\r\nabout Packingtown for months begging for work.",
        "This was a critical time\r\nin Jurgis’ life, and if he had been a weaker man he would have gone the\r\nway the rest did.",
        "Those out-of-work wretches would stand about the\r\npacking houses every morning till the police drove them away, and then\r\nthey would scatter among the saloons.",
        "Very few of them had the nerve to\r\nface the rebuffs that they would encounter by trying to get into the\r\nbuildings to interview the bosses; if they did not get a chance in the\r\nmorning, there would be nothing to do but hang about the saloons the\r\nrest of the day and night.",
        "Jurgis was saved from all this—partly, to be\r\nsure, because it was pleasant weather, and there was no need to be\r\nindoors; but mainly because he carried with him always the pitiful\r\nlittle face of his wife.",
        "He must get work, he told himself, fighting\r\nthe battle with despair every hour of the day.",
        "He must get work!",
        "He\r\nmust have a place again and some money saved up, before the next winter\r\ncame.",
        "But there was no work for him.",
        "He sought out all the members of his\r\nunion—Jurgis had stuck to the union through all this—and begged them to\r\nspeak a word for him.",
        "He went to every one he knew, asking for a\r\nchance, there or anywhere.",
        "He wandered all day through the buildings;\r\nand in a week or two, when he had been all over the yards, and into\r\nevery room to which he had access, and learned that there was not a job\r\nanywhere, he persuaded himself that there might have been a change in\r\nthe places he had first visited, and began the round all over; till\r\nfinally the watchmen and the “spotters” of the companies came to know\r\nhim by sight and to order him out with threats.",
        "Then there was nothing\r\nmore for him to do but go with the crowd in the morning, and keep in\r\nthe front row and look eager, and when he failed, go back home, and\r\nplay with little Kotrina and the baby.",
        "The peculiar bitterness of all this was that Jurgis saw so plainly the\r\nmeaning of it.",
        "In the beginning he had been fresh and strong, and he\r\nhad gotten a job the first day; but now he was second-hand, a damaged\r\narticle, so to speak, and they did not want him.",
        "They had got the best\r\nof him—they had worn him out, with their speeding-up and their\r\ncarelessness, and now they had thrown him away!",
        "And Jurgis would make\r\nthe acquaintance of others of these unemployed men and find that they\r\nhad all had the same experience.",
        "There were some, of course, who had\r\nwandered in from other places, who had been ground up in other mills;\r\nthere were others who were out from their own fault—some, for instance,\r\nwho had not been able to stand the awful grind without drink.",
        "The vast\r\nmajority, however, were simply the worn-out parts of the great\r\nmerciless packing machine; they had toiled there, and kept up with the\r\npace, some of them for ten or twenty years, until finally the time had\r\ncome when they could not keep up with it any more.",
        "Some had been\r\nfrankly told that they were too old, that a sprier man was needed;\r\nothers had given occasion, by some act of carelessness or incompetence;\r\nwith most, however, the occasion had been the same as with Jurgis.",
        "They\r\nhad been overworked and underfed so long, and finally some disease had\r\nlaid them on their backs; or they had cut themselves, and had blood\r\npoisoning, or met with some other accident.",
        "When a man came back after\r\nthat, he would get his place back only by the courtesy of the boss.",
        "To\r\nthis there was no exception, save when the accident was one for which\r\nthe firm was liable; in that case they would send a slippery lawyer to\r\nsee him, first to try to get him to sign away his claims, but if he was\r\ntoo smart for that, to promise him that he and his should always be\r\nprovided with work.",
        "This promise they would keep, strictly and to the\r\nletter—for two years.",
        "Two years was the “statute of limitations,” and\r\nafter that the victim could not sue.",
        "What happened to a man after any of these things, all depended upon the\r\ncircumstances.",
        "If he were of the highly skilled workers, he would\r\nprobably have enough saved up to tide him over.",
        "The best paid men, the\r\n“splitters,” made fifty cents an hour, which would be five or six\r\ndollars a day in the rush seasons, and one or two in the dullest.",
        "A man\r\ncould live and save on that; but then there were only half a dozen\r\nsplitters in each place, and one of them that Jurgis knew had a family\r\nof twenty-two children, all hoping to grow up to be splitters like\r\ntheir father.",
        "For an unskilled man, who made ten dollars a week in the\r\nrush seasons and five in the dull, it all depended upon his age and the\r\nnumber he had dependent upon him.",
        "An unmarried man could save, if he\r\ndid not drink, and if he was absolutely selfish—that is, if he paid no\r\nheed to the demands of his old parents, or of his little brothers and\r\nsisters, or of any other relatives he might have, as well as of the\r\nmembers of his union, and his chums, and the people who might be\r\nstarving to death next door.",
        "CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this time that Jurgis was looking for work occurred the death of\r\nlittle Kristoforas, one of the children of Teta Elzbieta.",
        "Both\r\nKristoforas and his brother, Juozapas, were cripples, the latter having\r\nlost one leg by having it run over, and Kristoforas having congenital\r\ndislocation of the hip, which made it impossible for him ever to walk.",
        "He was the last of Teta Elzbieta’s children, and perhaps he had been\r\nintended by nature to let her know that she had had enough.",
        "At any rate\r\nhe was wretchedly sick and undersized; he had the rickets, and though\r\nhe was over three years old, he was no bigger than an ordinary child of\r\none.",
        "All day long he would crawl around the floor in a filthy little\r\ndress, whining and fretting; because the floor was full of drafts he\r\nwas always catching cold, and snuffling because his nose ran.",
        "This made\r\nhim a nuisance, and a source of endless trouble in the family.",
        "For his\r\nmother, with unnatural perversity, loved him best of all her children,\r\nand made a perpetual fuss over him—would let him do anything\r\nundisturbed, and would burst into tears when his fretting drove Jurgis\r\nwild.",
        "And now he died.",
        "Perhaps it was the smoked sausage he had eaten that\r\nmorning—which may have been made out of some of the tubercular pork\r\nthat was condemned as unfit for export.",
        "At any rate, an hour after\r\neating it, the child had begun to cry with pain, and in another hour he\r\nwas rolling about on the floor in convulsions.",
        "Little Kotrina, who was\r\nall alone with him, ran out screaming for help, and after a while a\r\ndoctor came, but not until Kristoforas had howled his last howl.",
        "No one\r\nwas really sorry about this except poor Elzbieta, who was inconsolable.",
        "Jurgis announced that so far as he was concerned the child would have\r\nto be buried by the city, since they had no money for a funeral; and at\r\nthis the poor woman almost went out of her senses, wringing her hands\r\nand screaming with grief and despair.",
        "Her child to be buried in a\r\npauper’s grave!",
        "And her stepdaughter to stand by and hear it said\r\nwithout protesting!",
        "It was enough to make Ona’s father rise up out of\r\nhis grave to rebuke her!",
        "If it had come to this, they might as well\r\ngive up at once, and be buried all of them together!",
        ".",
        ".",
        ".",
        "In the end\r\nMarija said that she would help with ten dollars; and Jurgis being\r\nstill obdurate, Elzbieta went in tears and begged the money from the\r\nneighbors, and so little Kristoforas had a mass and a hearse with white\r\nplumes on it, and a tiny plot in a graveyard with a wooden cross to\r\nmark the place.",
        "The poor mother was not the same for months after that;\r\nthe mere sight of the floor where little Kristoforas had crawled about\r\nwould make her weep.",
        "He had never had a fair chance, poor little\r\nfellow, she would say.",
        "He had been handicapped from his birth.",
        "If only\r\nshe had heard about it in time, so that she might have had that great\r\ndoctor to cure him of his lameness!",
        ".",
        ".",
        ".",
        "Some time ago, Elzbieta was\r\ntold, a Chicago billionaire had paid a fortune to bring a great\r\nEuropean surgeon over to cure his little daughter of the same disease\r\nfrom which Kristoforas had suffered.",
        "And because this surgeon had to\r\nhave bodies to demonstrate upon, he announced that he would treat the\r\nchildren of the poor, a piece of magnanimity over which the papers\r\nbecame quite eloquent.",
        "Elzbieta, alas, did not read the papers, and no\r\none had told her; but perhaps it was as well, for just then they would\r\nnot have had the carfare to spare to go every day to wait upon the\r\nsurgeon, nor for that matter anybody with the time to take the child.",
        "All this while that he was seeking for work, there was a dark shadow\r\nhanging over Jurgis; as if a savage beast were lurking somewhere in the\r\npathway of his life, and he knew it, and yet could not help approaching\r\nthe place.",
        "There are all stages of being out of work in Packingtown,\r\nand he faced in dread the prospect of reaching the lowest.",
        "There is a\r\nplace that waits for the lowest man—the fertilizer plant!",
        "The men would talk about it in awe-stricken whispers.",
        "Not more than one\r\nin ten had ever really tried it; the other nine had contented\r\nthemselves with hearsay evidence and a peep through the door.",
        "There\r\nwere some things worse than even starving to death.",
        "They would ask\r\nJurgis if he had worked there yet, and if he meant to; and Jurgis would\r\ndebate the matter with himself.",
        "As poor as they were, and making all\r\nthe sacrifices that they were, would he dare to refuse any sort of work\r\nthat was offered to him, be it as horrible as ever it could?",
        "Would he\r\ndare to go home and eat bread that had been earned by Ona, weak and\r\ncomplaining as she was, knowing that he had been given a chance, and\r\nhad not had the nerve to take it?—And yet he might argue that way with\r\nhimself all day, and one glimpse into the fertilizer works would send\r\nhim away again shuddering.",
        "He was a man, and he would do his duty; he\r\nwent and made application—but surely he was not also required to hope\r\nfor success!",
        "The fertilizer works of Durham’s lay away from the rest of the plant.",
        "Few visitors ever saw them, and the few who did would come out looking\r\nlike Dante, of whom the peasants declared that he had been into hell.",
        "To this part of the yards came all the “tankage” and the waste products\r\nof all sorts; here they dried out the bones,—and in suffocating cellars\r\nwhere the daylight never came you might see men and women and children\r\nbending over whirling machines and sawing bits of bone into all sorts\r\nof shapes, breathing their lungs full of the fine dust, and doomed to\r\ndie, every one of them, within a certain definite time.",
        "Here they made\r\nthe blood into albumen, and made other foul-smelling things into things\r\nstill more foul-smelling.",
        "In the corridors and caverns where it was\r\ndone you might lose yourself as in the great caves of Kentucky.",
        "In the\r\ndust and the steam the electric lights would shine like far-off\r\ntwinkling stars—red and blue-green and purple stars, according to the\r\ncolor of the mist and the brew from which it came.",
        "For the odors of\r\nthese ghastly charnel houses there may be words in Lithuanian, but\r\nthere are none in English.",
        "The person entering would have to summon his\r\ncourage as for a cold-water plunge.",
        "He would go in like a man swimming\r\nunder water; he would put his handkerchief over his face, and begin to\r\ncough and choke; and then, if he were still obstinate, he would find\r\nhis head beginning to ring, and the veins in his forehead to throb,\r\nuntil finally he would be assailed by an overpowering blast of ammonia\r\nfumes, and would turn and run for his life, and come out half-dazed.",
        "On top of this were the rooms where they dried the “tankage,” the mass\r\nof brown stringy stuff that was left after the waste portions of the\r\ncarcasses had had the lard and tallow dried out of them.",
        "This dried\r\nmaterial they would then grind to a fine powder, and after they had\r\nmixed it up well with a mysterious but inoffensive brown rock which\r\nthey brought in and ground up by the hundreds of carloads for that\r\npurpose, the substance was ready to be put into bags and sent out to\r\nthe world as any one of a hundred different brands of standard bone\r\nphosphate.",
        "And then the farmer in Maine or California or Texas would\r\nbuy this, at say twenty-five dollars a ton, and plant it with his corn;\r\nand for several days after the operation the fields would have a strong\r\nodor, and the farmer and his wagon and the very horses that had hauled\r\nit would all have it too.",
        "In Packingtown the fertilizer is pure,\r\ninstead of being a flavoring, and instead of a ton or so spread out on\r\nseveral acres under the open sky, there are hundreds and thousands of\r\ntons of it in one building, heaped here and there in haystack piles,\r\ncovering the floor several inches deep, and filling the air with a\r\nchoking dust that becomes a blinding sandstorm when the wind stirs.",
        "It was to this building that Jurgis came daily, as if dragged by an\r\nunseen hand.",
        "The month of May was an exceptionally cool one, and his\r\nsecret prayers were granted; but early in June there came a\r\nrecord-breaking hot spell, and after that there were men wanted in the\r\nfertilizer mill.",
        "The boss of the grinding room had come to know Jurgis by this time, and\r\nhad marked him for a likely man; and so when he came to the door about\r\ntwo o’clock this breathless hot day, he felt a sudden spasm of pain\r\nshoot through him—the boss beckoned to him!",
        "In ten minutes more Jurgis\r\nhad pulled off his coat and overshirt, and set his teeth together and\r\ngone to work.",
        "Here was one more difficulty for him to meet and conquer!",
        "His labor took him about one minute to learn.",
        "Before him was one of the\r\nvents of the mill in which the fertilizer was being ground—rushing\r\nforth in a great brown river, with a spray of the finest dust flung\r\nforth in clouds.",
        "Jurgis was given a shovel, and along with half a dozen\r\nothers it was his task to shovel this fertilizer into carts.",
        "That\r\nothers were at work he knew by the sound, and by the fact that he\r\nsometimes collided with them; otherwise they might as well not have\r\nbeen there, for in the blinding dust storm a man could not see six feet\r\nin front of his face.",
        "When he had filled one cart he had to grope\r\naround him until another came, and if there was none on hand he\r\ncontinued to grope till one arrived.",
        "In five minutes he was, of course,\r\na mass of fertilizer from head to feet; they gave him a sponge to tie\r\nover his mouth, so that he could breathe, but the sponge did not\r\nprevent his lips and eyelids from caking up with it and his ears from\r\nfilling solid.",
        "He looked like a brown ghost at twilight—from hair to\r\nshoes he became the color of the building and of everything in it, and\r\nfor that matter a hundred yards outside it.",
        "The building had to be left\r\nopen, and when the wind blew Durham and Company lost a great deal of\r\nfertilizer.",
        "Working in his shirt sleeves, and with the thermometer at over a\r\nhundred, the phosphates soaked in through every pore of Jurgis’ skin,\r\nand in five minutes he had a headache, and in fifteen was almost dazed.",
        "The blood was pounding in his brain like an engine’s throbbing; there\r\nwas a frightful pain in the top of his skull, and he could hardly\r\ncontrol his hands.",
        "Still, with the memory of his four months’ siege\r\nbehind him, he fought on, in a frenzy of determination; and half an\r\nhour later he began to vomit—he vomited until it seemed as if his\r\ninwards must be torn into shreds.",
        "A man could get used to the\r\nfertilizer mill, the boss had said, if he would make up his mind to it;\r\nbut Jurgis now began to see that it was a question of making up his\r\nstomach.",
        "At the end of that day of horror, he could scarcely stand.",
        "He had to\r\ncatch himself now and then, and lean against a building and get his\r\nbearings.",
        "Most of the men, when they came out, made straight for a\r\nsaloon—they seemed to place fertilizer and rattlesnake poison in one\r\nclass.",
        "But Jurgis was too ill to think of drinking—he could only make\r\nhis way to the street and stagger on to a car.",
        "He had a sense of humor,\r\nand later on, when he became an old hand, he used to think it fun to\r\nboard a streetcar and see what happened.",
        "Now, however, he was too ill\r\nto notice it—how the people in the car began to gasp and sputter, to\r\nput their handkerchiefs to their noses, and transfix him with furious\r\nglances.",
        "Jurgis only knew that a man in front of him immediately got up\r\nand gave him a seat; and that half a minute later the two people on\r\neach side of him got up; and that in a full minute the crowded car was\r\nnearly empty—those passengers who could not get room on the platform\r\nhaving gotten out to walk.",
        "Of course Jurgis had made his home a miniature fertilizer mill a minute\r\nafter entering.",
        "The stuff was half an inch deep in his skin—his whole\r\nsystem was full of it, and it would have taken a week not merely of\r\nscrubbing, but of vigorous exercise, to get it out of him.",
        "As it was,\r\nhe could be compared with nothing known to men, save that newest\r\ndiscovery of the savants, a substance which emits energy for an\r\nunlimited time, without being itself in the least diminished in power.",
        "He smelled so that he made all the food at the table taste, and set the\r\nwhole family to vomiting; for himself it was three days before he could\r\nkeep anything upon his stomach—he might wash his hands, and use a knife\r\nand fork, but were not his mouth and throat filled with the poison?",
        "And still Jurgis stuck it out!",
        "In spite of splitting headaches he would\r\nstagger down to the plant and take up his stand once more, and begin to\r\nshovel in the blinding clouds of dust.",
        "And so at the end of the week he\r\nwas a fertilizer man for life—he was able to eat again, and though his\r\nhead never stopped aching, it ceased to be so bad that he could not\r\nwork.",
        "So there passed another summer.",
        "It was a summer of prosperity, all over\r\nthe country, and the country ate generously of packing house products,\r\nand there was plenty of work for all the family, in spite of the\r\npackers’ efforts to keep a superfluity of labor.",
        "They were again able\r\nto pay their debts and to begin to save a little sum; but there were\r\none or two sacrifices they considered too heavy to be made for long—it\r\nwas too bad that the boys should have to sell papers at their age.",
        "It\r\nwas utterly useless to caution them and plead with them; quite without\r\nknowing it, they were taking on the tone of their new environment.",
        "They\r\nwere learning to swear in voluble English; they were learning to pick\r\nup cigar stumps and smoke them, to pass hours of their time gambling\r\nwith pennies and dice and cigarette cards; they were learning the\r\nlocation of all the houses of prostitution on the “Lêvée,” and the\r\nnames of the “madames” who kept them, and the days when they gave their\r\nstate banquets, which the police captains and the big politicians all\r\nattended.",
        "If a visiting “country customer” were to ask them, they could\r\nshow him which was “Hinkydink’s” famous saloon, and could even point\r\nout to him by name the different gamblers and thugs and “hold-up men”\r\nwho made the place their headquarters.",
        "And worse yet, the boys were\r\ngetting out of the habit of coming home at night.",
        "What was the use,\r\nthey would ask, of wasting time and energy and a possible carfare\r\nriding out to the stockyards every night when the weather was pleasant\r\nand they could crawl under a truck or into an empty doorway and sleep\r\nexactly as well?",
        "So long as they brought home a half dollar for each\r\nday, what mattered it when they brought it?",
        "But Jurgis declared that\r\nfrom this to ceasing to come at all would not be a very long step, and\r\nso it was decided that Vilimas and Nikalojus should return to school in\r\nthe fall, and that instead Elzbieta should go out and get some work,\r\nher place at home being taken by her younger daughter.",
        "Little Kotrina was like most children of the poor, prematurely made\r\nold; she had to take care of her little brother, who was a cripple, and\r\nalso of the baby; she had to cook the meals and wash the dishes and\r\nclean house, and have supper ready when the workers came home in the\r\nevening.",
        "She was only thirteen, and small for her age, but she did all\r\nthis without a murmur; and her mother went out, and after trudging a\r\ncouple of days about the yards, settled down as a servant of a “sausage\r\nmachine.”\r\n\r\nElzbieta was used to working, but she found this change a hard one, for\r\nthe reason that she had to stand motionless upon her feet from seven\r\no’clock in the morning till half-past twelve, and again from one till\r\nhalf-past five.",
        "For the first few days it seemed to her that she could\r\nnot stand it—she suffered almost as much as Jurgis had from the\r\nfertilizer, and would come out at sundown with her head fairly reeling.",
        "Besides this, she was working in one of the dark holes, by electric\r\nlight, and the dampness, too, was deadly—there were always puddles of\r\nwater on the floor, and a sickening odor of moist flesh in the room.",
        "The people who worked here followed the ancient custom of nature,\r\nwhereby the ptarmigan is the color of dead leaves in the fall and of\r\nsnow in the winter, and the chameleon, who is black when he lies upon a\r\nstump and turns green when he moves to a leaf.",
        "The men and women who\r\nworked in this department were precisely the color of the “fresh\r\ncountry sausage” they made.",
        "The sausage-room was an interesting place to visit, for two or three\r\nminutes, and provided that you did not look at the people; the machines\r\nwere perhaps the most wonderful things in the entire plant.",
        "Presumably\r\nsausages were once chopped and stuffed by hand, and if so it would be\r\ninteresting to know how many workers had been displaced by these\r\ninventions.",
        "On one side of the room were the hoppers, into which men\r\nshoveled loads of meat and wheelbarrows full of spices; in these great\r\nbowls were whirling knives that made two thousand revolutions a minute,\r\nand when the meat was ground fine and adulterated with potato flour,\r\nand well mixed with water, it was forced to the stuffing machines on\r\nthe other side of the room.",
        "The latter were tended by women; there was\r\na sort of spout, like the nozzle of a hose, and one of the women would\r\ntake a long string of “casing” and put the end over the nozzle and then\r\nwork the whole thing on, as one works on the finger of a tight glove.",
        "This string would be twenty or thirty feet long, but the woman would\r\nhave it all on in a jiffy; and when she had several on, she would press\r\na lever, and a stream of sausage meat would be shot out, taking the\r\ncasing with it as it came.",
        "Thus one might stand and see appear,\r\nmiraculously born from the machine, a wriggling snake of sausage of\r\nincredible length.",
        "In front was a big pan which caught these creatures,\r\nand two more women who seized them as fast as they appeared and twisted\r\nthem into links.",
        "This was for the uninitiated the most perplexing work\r\nof all; for all that the woman had to give was a single turn of the\r\nwrist; and in some way she contrived to give it so that instead of an\r\nendless chain of sausages, one after another, there grew under her\r\nhands a bunch of strings, all dangling from a single center.",
        "It was\r\nquite like the feat of a prestidigitator—for the woman worked so fast\r\nthat the eye could literally not follow her, and there was only a mist\r\nof motion, and tangle after tangle of sausages appearing.",
        "In the midst\r\nof the mist, however, the visitor would suddenly notice the tense set\r\nface, with the two wrinkles graven in the forehead, and the ghastly\r\npallor of the cheeks; and then he would suddenly recollect that it was\r\ntime he was going on.",
        "The woman did not go on; she stayed right\r\nthere—hour after hour, day after day, year after year, twisting sausage\r\nlinks and racing with death.",
        "It was piecework, and she was apt to have\r\na family to keep alive; and stern and ruthless economic laws had\r\narranged it that she could only do this by working just as she did,\r\nwith all her soul upon her work, and with never an instant for a glance\r\nat the well-dressed ladies and gentlemen who came to stare at her, as\r\nat some wild beast in a menagerie.",
        "CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWith one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a\r\nsausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge of the great\r\nmajority of Packingtown swindles.",
        "For it was the custom, as they found,\r\nwhenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything\r\nelse, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage.",
        "With what\r\nhad been told them by Jonas, who had worked in the pickle rooms, they\r\ncould now study the whole of the spoiled-meat industry on the inside,\r\nand read a new and grim meaning into that old Packingtown jest—that\r\nthey use everything of the pig except the squeal.",
        "Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would\r\noften be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take\r\naway the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of\r\nall the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort\r\nof meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor\r\nand any odor they chose.",
        "In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious\r\napparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the\r\nplant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by\r\nplunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man\r\ncould fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds.",
        "And yet, in spite of\r\nthis, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so\r\nbad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them.",
        "To pump\r\ninto these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which\r\ndestroyed the odor—a process known to the workers as “giving them\r\nthirty per cent.” Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be\r\nfound some that had gone to the bad.",
        "Formerly these had been sold as\r\n“Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a\r\nnew device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad\r\npart generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.",
        "After this\r\ninvention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade—there\r\nwas only Number One Grade.",
        "The packers were always originating such\r\nschemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the\r\nodds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,”\r\nwhich were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the\r\nmeat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest\r\nhogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy\r\nthem—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled\r\n“head cheese!”\r\n\r\nIt was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the\r\ndepartment of Elzbieta.",
        "Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions-a-minute\r\nflyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was\r\nin a ham could make any difference.",
        "There was never the least attention\r\npaid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back\r\nfrom Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and\r\nwhite—it would be dosed with borax and glycerine, and dumped into the\r\nhoppers, and made over again for home consumption.",
        "There would be meat\r\nthat had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the\r\nworkers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.",
        "There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from\r\nleaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about\r\non it.",
        "It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man\r\ncould run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of\r\nthe dried dung of rats.",
        "These rats were nuisances, and the packers\r\nwould put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats,\r\nbread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.",
        "This is no fairy\r\nstory and no joke; the meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man\r\nwho did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he\r\nsaw one—there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with\r\nwhich a poisoned rat was a tidbit.",
        "There was no place for the men to\r\nwash their hands before they ate their dinner, and so they made a\r\npractice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the\r\nsausage.",
        "There were the butt-ends of smoked meat, and the scraps of\r\ncorned beef, and all the odds and ends of the waste of the plants, that\r\nwould be dumped into old barrels in the cellar and left there.",
        "Under\r\nthe system of rigid economy which the packers enforced, there were some\r\njobs that it only paid to do once in a long time, and among these was\r\nthe cleaning out of the waste barrels.",
        "Every spring they did it; and in\r\nthe barrels would be dirt and rust and old nails and stale water—and\r\ncartload after cartload of it would be taken up and dumped into the\r\nhoppers with fresh meat, and sent out to the public’s breakfast.",
        "Some\r\nof it they would make into “smoked” sausage—but as the smoking took\r\ntime, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry\r\ndepartment, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatine to\r\nmake it brown.",
        "All of their sausage came out of the same bowl, but when\r\nthey came to wrap it they would stamp some of it “special,” and for\r\nthis they would charge two cents more a pound.",
        "Such were the new surroundings in which Elzbieta was placed, and such\r\nwas the work she was compelled to do.",
        "It was stupefying, brutalizing\r\nwork; it left her no time to think, no strength for anything.",
        "She was\r\npart of the machine she tended, and every faculty that was not needed\r\nfor the machine was doomed to be crushed out of existence.",
        "There was\r\nonly one mercy about the cruel grind—that it gave her the gift of\r\ninsensibility.",
        "Little by little she sank into a torpor—she fell silent.",
        "She would meet Jurgis and Ona in the evening, and the three would walk\r\nhome together, often without saying a word.",
        "Ona, too, was falling into\r\na habit of silence—Ona, who had once gone about singing like a bird.",
        "She was sick and miserable, and often she would barely have strength\r\nenough to drag herself home.",
        "And there they would eat what they had to\r\neat, and afterward, because there was only their misery to talk of,\r\nthey would crawl into bed and fall into a stupor and never stir until\r\nit was time to get up again, and dress by candlelight, and go back to\r\nthe machines.",
        "They were so numbed that they did not even suffer much\r\nfrom hunger, now; only the children continued to fret when the food ran\r\nshort.",
        "Yet the soul of Ona was not dead—the souls of none of them were dead,\r\nbut only sleeping; and now and then they would waken, and these were\r\ncruel times.",
        "The gates of memory would roll open—old joys would stretch\r\nout their arms to them, old hopes and dreams would call to them, and\r\nthey would stir beneath the burden that lay upon them, and feel its\r\nforever immeasurable weight.",
        "They could not even cry out beneath it;\r\nbut anguish would seize them, more dreadful than the agony of death.",
        "It\r\nwas a thing scarcely to be spoken—a thing never spoken by all the\r\nworld, that will not know its own defeat.",
        "They were beaten; they had lost the game, they were swept aside.",
        "It was\r\nnot less tragic because it was so sordid, because it had to do with\r\nwages and grocery bills and rents.",
        "They had dreamed of freedom; of a\r\nchance to look about them and learn something; to be decent and clean,\r\nto see their child grow up to be strong.",
        "And now it was all gone—it\r\nwould never be!",
        "They had played the game and they had lost.",
        "Six years\r\nmore of toil they had to face before they could expect the least\r\nrespite, the cessation of the payments upon the house; and how cruelly\r\ncertain it was that they could never stand six years of such a life as\r\nthey were living!",
        "They were lost, they were going down—and there was no\r\ndeliverance for them, no hope; for all the help it gave them the vast\r\ncity in which they lived might have been an ocean waste, a wilderness,\r\na desert, a tomb.",
        "So often this mood would come to Ona, in the\r\nnighttime, when something wakened her; she would lie, afraid of the\r\nbeating of her own heart, fronting the blood-red eyes of the old\r\nprimeval terror of life.",
        "Once she cried aloud, and woke Jurgis, who was\r\ntired and cross.",
        "After that she learned to weep silently—their moods so\r\nseldom came together now!",
        "It was as if their hopes were buried in\r\nseparate graves.",
        "Jurgis, being a man, had troubles of his own.",
        "There was another specter\r\nfollowing him.",
        "He had never spoken of it, nor would he allow any one\r\nelse to speak of it—he had never acknowledged its existence to himself.",
        "Yet the battle with it took all the manhood that he had—and once or\r\ntwice, alas, a little more.",
        "Jurgis had discovered drink.",
        "He was working in the steaming pit of hell; day after day, week after\r\nweek—until now, there was not an organ of his body that did its work\r\nwithout pain, until the sound of ocean breakers echoed in his head day\r\nand night, and the buildings swayed and danced before him as he went\r\ndown the street.",
        "And from all the unending horror of this there was a\r\nrespite, a deliverance—he could drink!",
        "He could forget the pain, he\r\ncould slip off the burden; he would see clearly again, he would be\r\nmaster of his brain, of his thoughts, of his will.",
        "His dead self would\r\nstir in him, and he would find himself laughing and cracking jokes with\r\nhis companions—he would be a man again, and master of his life.",
        "It was not an easy thing for Jurgis to take more than two or three\r\ndrinks.",
        "With the first drink he could eat a meal, and he could persuade\r\nhimself that that was economy; with the second he could eat another\r\nmeal—but there would come a time when he could eat no more, and then to\r\npay for a drink was an unthinkable extravagance, a defiance of the\r\nage-long instincts of his hunger-haunted class.",
        "One day, however, he\r\ntook the plunge, and drank up all that he had in his pockets, and went\r\nhome half “piped,” as the men phrase it.",
        "He was happier than he had\r\nbeen in a year; and yet, because he knew that the happiness would not\r\nlast, he was savage, too with those who would wreck it, and with the\r\nworld, and with his life; and then again, beneath this, he was sick\r\nwith the shame of himself.",
        "Afterward, when he saw the despair of his\r\nfamily, and reckoned up the money he had spent, the tears came into his\r\neyes, and he began the long battle with the specter.",
        "It was a battle that had no end, that never could have one.",
        "But Jurgis\r\ndid not realize that very clearly; he was not given much time for\r\nreflection.",
        "He simply knew that he was always fighting.",
        "Steeped in\r\nmisery and despair as he was, merely to walk down the street was to be\r\nput upon the rack.",
        "There was surely a saloon on the corner—perhaps on\r\nall four corners, and some in the middle of the block as well; and each\r\none stretched out a hand to him each one had a personality of its own,\r\nallurements unlike any other.",
        "Going and coming—before sunrise and after\r\ndark—there was warmth and a glow of light, and the steam of hot food,\r\nand perhaps music, or a friendly face, and a word of good cheer.",
        "Jurgis\r\ndeveloped a fondness for having Ona on his arm whenever he went out on\r\nthe street, and he would hold her tightly, and walk fast.",
        "It was\r\npitiful to have Ona know of this—it drove him wild to think of it; the\r\nthing was not fair, for Ona had never tasted drink, and so could not\r\nunderstand.",
        "Sometimes, in desperate hours, he would find himself\r\nwishing that she might learn what it was, so that he need not be\r\nashamed in her presence.",
        "They might drink together, and escape from the\r\nhorror—escape for a while, come what would.",
        "So there came a time when nearly all the conscious life of Jurgis\r\nconsisted of a struggle with the craving for liquor.",
        "He would have ugly\r\nmoods, when he hated Ona and the whole family, because they stood in\r\nhis way.",
        "He was a fool to have married; he had tied himself down, had\r\nmade himself a slave.",
        "It was all because he was a married man that he\r\nwas compelled to stay in the yards; if it had not been for that he\r\nmight have gone off like Jonas, and to hell with the packers.",
        "There\r\nwere few single men in the fertilizer mill—and those few were working\r\nonly for a chance to escape.",
        "Meantime, too, they had something to think\r\nabout while they worked,—they had the memory of the last time they had\r\nbeen drunk, and the hope of the time when they would be drunk again.",
        "As\r\nfor Jurgis, he was expected to bring home every penny; he could not\r\neven go with the men at noontime—he was supposed to sit down and eat\r\nhis dinner on a pile of fertilizer dust.",
        "This was not always his mood, of course; he still loved his family.",
        "But\r\njust now was a time of trial.",
        "Poor little Antanas, for instance—who had\r\nnever failed to win him with a smile—little Antanas was not smiling\r\njust now, being a mass of fiery red pimples.",
        "He had had all the\r\ndiseases that babies are heir to, in quick succession, scarlet fever,\r\nmumps, and whooping cough in the first year, and now he was down with\r\nthe measles.",
        "There was no one to attend him but Kotrina; there was no\r\ndoctor to help him, because they were too poor, and children did not\r\ndie of the measles—at least not often.",
        "Now and then Kotrina would find\r\ntime to sob over his woes, but for the greater part of the time he had\r\nto be left alone, barricaded upon the bed.",
        "The floor was full of\r\ndrafts, and if he caught cold he would die.",
        "At night he was tied down,\r\nlest he should kick the covers off him, while the family lay in their\r\nstupor of exhaustion.",
        "He would lie and scream for hours, almost in\r\nconvulsions; and then, when he was worn out, he would lie whimpering\r\nand wailing in his torment.",
        "He was burning up with fever, and his eyes\r\nwere running sores; in the daytime he was a thing uncanny and impish to\r\nbehold, a plaster of pimples and sweat, a great purple lump of misery.",
        "Yet all this was not really as cruel as it sounds, for, sick as he was,\r\nlittle Antanas was the least unfortunate member of that family.",
        "He was\r\nquite able to bear his sufferings—it was as if he had all these\r\ncomplaints to show what a prodigy of health he was.",
        "He was the child of\r\nhis parents’ youth and joy; he grew up like the conjurer’s rosebush,\r\nand all the world was his oyster.",
        "In general, he toddled around the\r\nkitchen all day with a lean and hungry look—the portion of the family’s\r\nallowance that fell to him was not enough, and he was unrestrainable in\r\nhis demand for more.",
        "Antanas was but little over a year old, and\r\nalready no one but his father could manage him.",
        "It seemed as if he had taken all of his mother’s strength—had left\r\nnothing for those that might come after him.",
        "Ona was with child again\r\nnow, and it was a dreadful thing to contemplate; even Jurgis, dumb and\r\ndespairing as he was, could not but understand that yet other agonies\r\nwere on the way, and shudder at the thought of them.",
        "For Ona was visibly going to pieces.",
        "In the first place she was\r\ndeveloping a cough, like the one that had killed old Dede Antanas.",
        "She\r\nhad had a trace of it ever since that fatal morning when the greedy\r\nstreetcar corporation had turned her out into the rain; but now it was\r\nbeginning to grow serious, and to wake her up at night.",
        "Even worse than\r\nthat was the fearful nervousness from which she suffered; she would\r\nhave frightful headaches and fits of aimless weeping; and sometimes she\r\nwould come home at night shuddering and moaning, and would fling\r\nherself down upon the bed and burst into tears.",
        "Several times she was\r\nquite beside herself and hysterical; and then Jurgis would go half-mad\r\nwith fright.",
        "Elzbieta would explain to him that it could not be helped,\r\nthat a woman was subject to such things when she was pregnant; but he\r\nwas hardly to be persuaded, and would beg and plead to know what had\r\nhappened.",
        "She had never been like this before, he would argue—it was\r\nmonstrous and unthinkable.",
        "It was the life she had to live, the\r\naccursed work she had to do, that was killing her by inches.",
        "She was\r\nnot fitted for it—no woman was fitted for it, no woman ought to be\r\nallowed to do such work; if the world could not keep them alive any\r\nother way it ought to kill them at once and be done with it.",
        "They ought\r\nnot to marry, to have children; no workingman ought to marry—if he,\r\nJurgis, had known what a woman was like, he would have had his eyes\r\ntorn out first.",
        "So he would carry on, becoming half hysterical himself,\r\nwhich was an unbearable thing to see in a big man; Ona would pull\r\nherself together and fling herself into his arms, begging him to stop,\r\nto be still, that she would be better, it would be all right.",
        "So she\r\nwould lie and sob out her grief upon his shoulder, while he gazed at\r\nher, as helpless as a wounded animal, the target of unseen enemies.",
        "CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of these perplexing things was in the summer; and each\r\ntime Ona would promise him with terror in her voice that it would not\r\nhappen again—but in vain.",
        "Each crisis would leave Jurgis more and more\r\nfrightened, more disposed to distrust Elzbieta’s consolations, and to\r\nbelieve that there was some terrible thing about all this that he was\r\nnot allowed to know.",
        "Once or twice in these outbreaks he caught Ona’s\r\neye, and it seemed to him like the eye of a hunted animal; there were\r\nbroken phrases of anguish and despair now and then, amid her frantic\r\nweeping.",
        "It was only because he was so numb and beaten himself that\r\nJurgis did not worry more about this.",
        "But he never thought of it,\r\nexcept when he was dragged to it—he lived like a dumb beast of burden,\r\nknowing only the moment in which he was.",
        "The winter was coming on again, more menacing and cruel than ever.",
        "It\r\nwas October, and the holiday rush had begun.",
        "It was necessary for the\r\npacking machines to grind till late at night to provide food that would\r\nbe eaten at Christmas breakfasts; and Marija and Elzbieta and Ona, as\r\npart of the machine, began working fifteen or sixteen hours a day.",
        "There was no choice about this—whatever work there was to be done they\r\nhad to do, if they wished to keep their places; besides that, it added\r\nanother pittance to their incomes.",
        "So they staggered on with the awful\r\nload.",
        "They would start work every morning at seven, and eat their\r\ndinners at noon, and then work until ten or eleven at night without\r\nanother mouthful of food.",
        "Jurgis wanted to wait for them, to help them\r\nhome at night, but they would not think of this; the fertilizer mill\r\nwas not running overtime, and there was no place for him to wait save\r\nin a saloon.",
        "Each would stagger out into the darkness, and make her way\r\nto the corner, where they met; or if the others had already gone, would\r\nget into a car, and begin a painful struggle to keep awake.",
        "When they\r\ngot home they were always too tired either to eat or to undress; they\r\nwould crawl into bed with their shoes on, and lie like logs.",
        "If they\r\nshould fail, they would certainly be lost; if they held out, they might\r\nhave enough coal for the winter.",
        "A day or two before Thanksgiving Day there came a snowstorm.",
        "It began\r\nin the afternoon, and by evening two inches had fallen.",
        "Jurgis tried to\r\nwait for the women, but went into a saloon to get warm, and took two\r\ndrinks, and came out and ran home to escape from the demon; there he\r\nlay down to wait for them, and instantly fell asleep.",
        "When he opened\r\nhis eyes again he was in the midst of a nightmare, and found Elzbieta\r\nshaking him and crying out.",
        "At first he could not realize what she was\r\nsaying—Ona had not come home.",
        "What time was it, he asked.",
        "It was\r\nmorning—time to be up.",
        "Ona had not been home that night!",
        "And it was\r\nbitter cold, and a foot of snow on the ground.",
        "Jurgis sat up with a start.",
        "Marija was crying with fright and the\r\nchildren were wailing in sympathy—little Stanislovas in addition,\r\nbecause the terror of the snow was upon him.",
        "Jurgis had nothing to put\r\non but his shoes and his coat, and in half a minute he was out of the\r\ndoor.",
        "Then, however, he realized that there was no need of haste, that\r\nhe had no idea where to go.",
        "It was still dark as midnight, and the\r\nthick snowflakes were sifting down—everything was so silent that he\r\ncould hear the rustle of them as they fell.",
        "In the few seconds that he\r\nstood there hesitating he was covered white.",
        "He set off at a run for the yards, stopping by the way to inquire in\r\nthe saloons that were open.",
        "Ona might have been overcome on the way; or\r\nelse she might have met with an accident in the machines.",
        "When he got\r\nto the place where she worked he inquired of one of the watchmen—there\r\nhad not been any accident, so far as the man had heard.",
        "At the time\r\noffice, which he found already open, the clerk told him that Ona’s\r\ncheck had been turned in the night before, showing that she had left\r\nher work.",
        "After that there was nothing for him to do but wait, pacing back and\r\nforth in the snow, meantime, to keep from freezing.",
        "Already the yards\r\nwere full of activity; cattle were being unloaded from the cars in the\r\ndistance, and across the way the “beef-luggers” were toiling in the\r\ndarkness, carrying two-hundred-pound quarters of bullocks into the\r\nrefrigerator cars.",
        "Before the first streaks of daylight there came the\r\ncrowding throngs of workingmen, shivering, and swinging their dinner\r\npails as they hurried by.",
        "Jurgis took up his stand by the time-office\r\nwindow, where alone there was light enough for him to see; the snow\r\nfell so quick that it was only by peering closely that he could make\r\nsure that Ona did not pass him.",
        "Seven o’clock came, the hour when the great packing machine began to\r\nmove.",
        "Jurgis ought to have been at his place in the fertilizer mill;\r\nbut instead he was waiting, in an agony of fear, for Ona.",
        "It was\r\nfifteen minutes after the hour when he saw a form emerge from the snow\r\nmist, and sprang toward it with a cry.",
        "It was she, running swiftly; as\r\nshe saw him, she staggered forward, and half fell into his outstretched\r\narms.",
        "“What has been the matter?” he cried, anxiously.",
        "“Where have you been?”\r\n\r\nIt was several seconds before she could get breath to answer him.",
        "“I\r\ncouldn’t get home,” she exclaimed.",
        "“The snow—the cars had stopped.”\r\n\r\n“But where were you then?” he demanded.",
        "“I had to go home with a friend,” she panted—“with Jadvyga.”\r\n\r\nJurgis drew a deep breath; but then he noticed that she was sobbing and\r\ntrembling—as if in one of those nervous crises that he dreaded so.",
        "“But\r\nwhat’s the matter?” he cried.",
        "“What has happened?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jurgis, I was so frightened!” she said, clinging to him wildly.",
        "“I\r\nhave been so worried!”\r\n\r\nThey were near the time station window, and people were staring at\r\nthem.",
        "Jurgis led her away.",
        "“How do you mean?” he asked, in perplexity.",
        "“I was afraid—I was just afraid!” sobbed Ona.",
        "“I knew you wouldn’t know\r\nwhere I was, and I didn’t know what you might do.",
        "I tried to get home,\r\nbut I was so tired.",
        "Oh, Jurgis, Jurgis!”\r\n\r\nHe was so glad to get her back that he could not think clearly about\r\nanything else.",
        "It did not seem strange to him that she should be so\r\nvery much upset; all her fright and incoherent protestations did not\r\nmatter since he had her back.",
        "He let her cry away her tears; and then,\r\nbecause it was nearly eight o’clock, and they would lose another hour\r\nif they delayed, he left her at the packing house door, with her\r\nghastly white face and her haunted eyes of terror.",
        "There was another brief interval.",
        "Christmas was almost come; and\r\nbecause the snow still held, and the searching cold, morning after\r\nmorning Jurgis half carried his wife to her post, staggering with her\r\nthrough the darkness; until at last, one night, came the end.",
        "It lacked but three days of the holidays.",
        "About midnight Marija and\r\nElzbieta came home, exclaiming in alarm when they found that Ona had\r\nnot come.",
        "The two had agreed to meet her; and, after waiting, had gone\r\nto the room where she worked; only to find that the ham-wrapping girls\r\nhad quit work an hour before, and left.",
        "There was no snow that night,\r\nnor was it especially cold; and still Ona had not come!",
        "Something more\r\nserious must be wrong this time.",
        "They aroused Jurgis, and he sat up and listened crossly to the story.",
        "She must have gone home again with Jadvyga, he said; Jadvyga lived only\r\ntwo blocks from the yards, and perhaps she had been tired.",
        "Nothing\r\ncould have happened to her—and even if there had, there was nothing\r\ncould be done about it until morning.",
        "Jurgis turned over in his bed,\r\nand was snoring again before the two had closed the door.",
        "In the morning, however, he was up and out nearly an hour before the\r\nusual time.",
        "Jadvyga Marcinkus lived on the other side of the yards,\r\nbeyond Halsted Street, with her mother and sisters, in a single\r\nbasement room—for Mikolas had recently lost one hand from blood\r\npoisoning, and their marriage had been put off forever.",
        "The door of the\r\nroom was in the rear, reached by a narrow court, and Jurgis saw a light\r\nin the window and heard something frying as he passed; he knocked, half\r\nexpecting that Ona would answer.",
        "Instead there was one of Jadvyga’s little sisters, who gazed at him\r\nthrough a crack in the door.",
        "“Where’s Ona?” he demanded; and the child\r\nlooked at him in perplexity.",
        "“Ona?” she said.",
        "“Yes,” said Jurgis, “isn’t she here?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the child, and Jurgis gave a start.",
        "A moment later came\r\nJadvyga, peering over the child’s head.",
        "When she saw who it was, she\r\nslid around out of sight, for she was not quite dressed.",
        "Jurgis must\r\nexcuse her, she began, her mother was very ill—\r\n\r\n“Ona isn’t here?” Jurgis demanded, too alarmed to wait for her to\r\nfinish.",
        "“Why, no,” said Jadvyga.",
        "“What made you think she would be here?",
        "Had\r\nshe said she was coming?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered.",
        "“But she hasn’t come home—and I thought she would be\r\nhere the same as before.”\r\n\r\n“As before?” echoed Jadvyga, in perplexity.",
        "“The time she spent the night here,” said Jurgis.",
        "“There must be some mistake,” she answered, quickly.",
        "“Ona has never\r\nspent the night here.”\r\n\r\nHe was only half able to realize the words.",
        "“Why—why—” he exclaimed.",
        "“Two weeks ago.",
        "Jadvyga!",
        "She told me so the night it snowed, and she\r\ncould not get home.”\r\n\r\n“There must be some mistake,” declared the girl, again; “she didn’t\r\ncome here.”\r\n\r\nHe steadied himself by the door-sill; and Jadvyga in her anxiety—for\r\nshe was fond of Ona—opened the door wide, holding her jacket across her\r\nthroat.",
        "“Are you sure you didn’t misunderstand her?” she cried.",
        "“She\r\nmust have meant somewhere else.",
        "She—”\r\n\r\n“She said here,” insisted Jurgis.",
        "“She told me all about you, and how\r\nyou were, and what you said.",
        "Are you sure?",
        "You haven’t forgotten?",
        "You\r\nweren’t away?”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” she exclaimed—and then came a peevish voice—“Jadvyga, you are\r\ngiving the baby a cold.",
        "Shut the door!” Jurgis stood for half a minute\r\nmore, stammering his perplexity through an eighth of an inch of crack;\r\nand then, as there was really nothing more to be said, he excused\r\nhimself and went away.",
        "He walked on half dazed, without knowing where he went.",
        "Ona had\r\ndeceived him!",
        "She had lied to him!",
        "And what could it mean—where had she\r\nbeen?",
        "Where was she now?",
        "He could hardly grasp the thing—much less try\r\nto solve it; but a hundred wild surmises came to him, a sense of\r\nimpending calamity overwhelmed him.",
        "Because there was nothing else to do, he went back to the time office\r\nto watch again.",
        "He waited until nearly an hour after seven, and then\r\nwent to the room where Ona worked to make inquiries of Ona’s\r\n“forelady.” The “forelady,” he found, had not yet come; all the lines\r\nof cars that came from downtown were stalled—there had been an accident\r\nin the powerhouse, and no cars had been running since last night.",
        "Meantime, however, the ham-wrappers were working away, with some one\r\nelse in charge of them.",
        "The girl who answered Jurgis was busy, and as\r\nshe talked she looked to see if she were being watched.",
        "Then a man came\r\nup, wheeling a truck; he knew Jurgis for Ona’s husband, and was curious\r\nabout the mystery.",
        "“Maybe the cars had something to do with it,” he suggested—“maybe she\r\nhad gone down-town.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jurgis, “she never went down-town.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” said the man.",
        "Jurgis thought he saw him exchange a swift\r\nglance with the girl as he spoke, and he demanded quickly.",
        "“What do you\r\nknow about it?”\r\n\r\nBut the man had seen that the boss was watching him; he started on\r\nagain, pushing his truck.",
        "“I don’t know anything about it,” he said,\r\nover his shoulder.",
        "“How should I know where your wife goes?”\r\n\r\nThen Jurgis went out again and paced up and down before the building.",
        "All the morning he stayed there, with no thought of his work.",
        "About\r\nnoon he went to the police station to make inquiries, and then came\r\nback again for another anxious vigil.",
        "Finally, toward the middle of the\r\nafternoon, he set out for home once more.",
        "He was walking out Ashland Avenue.",
        "The streetcars had begun running\r\nagain, and several passed him, packed to the steps with people.",
        "The\r\nsight of them set Jurgis to thinking again of the man’s sarcastic\r\nremark; and half involuntarily he found himself watching the cars—with\r\nthe result that he gave a sudden startled exclamation, and stopped\r\nshort in his tracks.",
        "Then he broke into a run.",
        "For a whole block he tore after the car, only\r\na little ways behind.",
        "That rusty black hat with the drooping red\r\nflower, it might not be Ona’s, but there was very little likelihood of\r\nit.",
        "He would know for certain very soon, for she would get out two\r\nblocks ahead.",
        "He slowed down, and let the car go on.",
        "She got out: and as soon as she was out of sight on the side street\r\nJurgis broke into a run.",
        "Suspicion was rife in him now, and he was not\r\nashamed to shadow her: he saw her turn the corner near their home, and\r\nthen he ran again, and saw her as she went up the porch steps of the\r\nhouse.",
        "After that he turned back, and for five minutes paced up and\r\ndown, his hands clenched tightly and his lips set, his mind in a\r\nturmoil.",
        "Then he went home and entered.",
        "As he opened the door, he saw Elzbieta, who had also been looking for\r\nOna, and had come home again.",
        "She was now on tiptoe, and had a finger\r\non her lips.",
        "Jurgis waited until she was close to him.",
        "“Don’t make any noise,” she whispered, hurriedly.",
        "“What’s the matter’?” he asked.",
        "“Ona is asleep,” she panted.",
        "“She’s\r\nbeen very ill.",
        "I’m afraid her mind’s been wandering, Jurgis.",
        "She was\r\nlost on the street all night, and I’ve only just succeeded in getting\r\nher quiet.”\r\n\r\n“When did she come in?” he asked.",
        "“Soon after you left this morning,” said Elzbieta.",
        "“And has she been out since?”\r\n\r\n“No, of course not.",
        "She’s so weak, Jurgis, she—”\r\n\r\nAnd he set his teeth hard together.",
        "“You are lying to me,” he said.",
        "Elzbieta started, and turned pale.",
        "“Why!” she gasped.",
        "“What do you\r\nmean?”\r\n\r\nBut Jurgis did not answer.",
        "He pushed her aside, and strode to the\r\nbedroom door and opened it.",
        "Ona was sitting on the bed.",
        "She turned a startled look upon him as he\r\nentered.",
        "He closed the door in Elzbieta’s face, and went toward his\r\nwife.",
        "“Where have you been?” he demanded.",
        "She had her hands clasped tightly in her lap, and he saw that her face\r\nwas as white as paper, and drawn with pain.",
        "She gasped once or twice as\r\nshe tried to answer him, and then began, speaking low, and swiftly.",
        "“Jurgis, I—I think I have been out of my mind.",
        "I started to come last\r\nnight, and I could not find the way.",
        "I walked—I walked all night, I\r\nthink, and—and I only got home—this morning.”\r\n\r\n“You needed a rest,” he said, in a hard tone.",
        "“Why did you go out\r\nagain?”\r\n\r\nHe was looking her fairly in the face, and he could read the sudden\r\nfear and wild uncertainty that leaped into her eyes.",
        "“I—I had to go\r\nto—to the store,” she gasped, almost in a whisper, “I had to go—”\r\n\r\n“You are lying to me,” said Jurgis.",
        "Then he clenched his hands and took\r\na step toward her.",
        "“Why do you lie to me?” he cried, fiercely.",
        "“What\r\nare you doing that you have to lie to me?”\r\n\r\n“Jurgis!” she exclaimed, starting up in fright.",
        "“Oh, Jurgis, how can\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“You have lied to me, I say!” he cried.",
        "“You told me you had been to\r\nJadvyga’s house that other night, and you hadn’t.",
        "You had been where\r\nyou were last night—somewheres downtown, for I saw you get off the car.",
        "Where were you?”\r\n\r\nIt was as if he had struck a knife into her.",
        "She seemed to go all to\r\npieces.",
        "For half a second she stood, reeling and swaying, staring at\r\nhim with horror in her eyes; then, with a cry of anguish, she tottered\r\nforward, stretching out her arms to him.",
        "But he stepped aside,\r\ndeliberately, and let her fall.",
        "She caught herself at the side of the\r\nbed, and then sank down, burying her face in her hands and bursting\r\ninto frantic weeping.",
        "There came one of those hysterical crises that had so often dismayed\r\nhim.",
        "Ona sobbed and wept, her fear and anguish building themselves up\r\ninto long climaxes.",
        "Furious gusts of emotion would come sweeping over\r\nher, shaking her as the tempest shakes the trees upon the hills; all\r\nher frame would quiver and throb with them—it was as if some dreadful\r\nthing rose up within her and took possession of her, torturing her,\r\ntearing her.",
        "This thing had been wont to set Jurgis quite beside\r\nhimself; but now he stood with his lips set tightly and his hands\r\nclenched—she might weep till she killed herself, but she should not\r\nmove him this time—not an inch, not an inch.",
        "Because the sounds she\r\nmade set his blood to running cold and his lips to quivering in spite\r\nof himself, he was glad of the diversion when Teta Elzbieta, pale with\r\nfright, opened the door and rushed in; yet he turned upon her with an\r\noath.",
        "“Go out!” he cried, “go out!” And then, as she stood hesitating,\r\nabout to speak, he seized her by the arm, and half flung her from the\r\nroom, slamming the door and barring it with a table.",
        "Then he turned\r\nagain and faced Ona, crying—“Now, answer me!”\r\n\r\nYet she did not hear him—she was still in the grip of the fiend.",
        "Jurgis\r\ncould see her outstretched hands, shaking and twitching, roaming here\r\nand there over the bed at will, like living things; he could see\r\nconvulsive shudderings start in her body and run through her limbs.",
        "She\r\nwas sobbing and choking—it was as if there were too many sounds for one\r\nthroat, they came chasing each other, like waves upon the sea.",
        "Then her\r\nvoice would begin to rise into screams, louder and louder until it\r\nbroke in wild, horrible peals of laughter.",
        "Jurgis bore it until he\r\ncould bear it no longer, and then he sprang at her, seizing her by the\r\nshoulders and shaking her, shouting into her ear: “Stop it, I say!",
        "Stop\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, out of her agony; then she fell forward at his\r\nfeet.",
        "She caught them in her hands, in spite of his efforts to step\r\naside, and with her face upon the floor lay writhing.",
        "It made a choking\r\nin Jurgis’ throat to hear her, and he cried again, more savagely than\r\nbefore: “Stop it, I say!”\r\n\r\nThis time she heeded him, and caught her breath and lay silent, save\r\nfor the gasping sobs that wrenched all her frame.",
        "For a long minute she\r\nlay there, perfectly motionless, until a cold fear seized her husband,\r\nthinking that she was dying.",
        "Suddenly, however, he heard her voice,\r\nfaintly: “Jurgis!",
        "Jurgis!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he said.",
        "He had to bend down to her, she was so weak.",
        "She was pleading with him,\r\nin broken phrases, painfully uttered: “Have faith in me!",
        "Believe me!”\r\n\r\n“Believe what?” he cried.",
        "“Believe that I—that I know best—that I love you!",
        "And do not ask\r\nme—what you did.",
        "Oh, Jurgis, please, please!",
        "It is for the best—it is—”\r\n\r\nHe started to speak again, but she rushed on frantically, heading him\r\noff.",
        "“If you will only do it!",
        "If you will only—only believe me!",
        "It\r\nwasn’t my fault—I couldn’t help it—it will be all right—it is\r\nnothing—it is no harm.",
        "Oh, Jurgis—please, please!”\r\n\r\nShe had hold of him, and was trying to raise herself to look at him; he\r\ncould feel the palsied shaking of her hands and the heaving of the\r\nbosom she pressed against him.",
        "She managed to catch one of his hands\r\nand gripped it convulsively, drawing it to her face, and bathing it in\r\nher tears.",
        "“Oh, believe me, believe me!” she wailed again; and he\r\nshouted in fury, “I will not!”\r\n\r\nBut still she clung to him, wailing aloud in her despair: “Oh, Jurgis,\r\nthink what you are doing!",
        "It will ruin us—it will ruin us!",
        "Oh, no, you\r\nmust not do it!",
        "No, don’t, don’t do it.",
        "You must not do it!",
        "It will\r\ndrive me mad—it will kill me—no, no, Jurgis, I am crazy—it is nothing.",
        "You do not really need to know.",
        "We can be happy—we can love each other\r\njust the same.",
        "Oh, please, please, believe me!”\r\n\r\nHer words fairly drove him wild.",
        "He tore his hands loose, and flung her\r\noff.",
        "“Answer me,” he cried.",
        "“God damn it, I say—answer me!”\r\n\r\nShe sank down upon the floor, beginning to cry again.",
        "It was like\r\nlistening to the moan of a damned soul, and Jurgis could not stand it.",
        "He smote his fist upon the table by his side, and shouted again at her,\r\n“Answer me!”\r\n\r\nShe began to scream aloud, her voice like the voice of some wild beast:\r\n“Ah!",
        "Ah!",
        "I can’t!",
        "I can’t do it!”\r\n\r\n“Why can’t you do it?” he shouted.",
        "“I don’t know how!”\r\n\r\nHe sprang and caught her by the arm, lifting her up, and glaring into\r\nher face.",
        "“Tell me where you were last night!” he panted.",
        "“Quick, out\r\nwith it!”\r\n\r\nThen she began to whisper, one word at a time: “I—was in—a\r\nhouse—downtown—”\r\n\r\n“What house?",
        "What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nShe tried to hide her eyes away, but he held her.",
        "“Miss Henderson’s\r\nhouse,” she gasped.",
        "He did not understand at first.",
        "“Miss Henderson’s\r\nhouse,” he echoed.",
        "And then suddenly, as in an explosion, the horrible\r\ntruth burst over him, and he reeled and staggered back with a scream.",
        "He caught himself against the wall, and put his hand to his forehead,\r\nstaring about him, and whispering, “Jesus!",
        "Jesus!”\r\n\r\nAn instant later he leaped at her, as she lay groveling at his feet.",
        "He\r\nseized her by the throat.",
        "“Tell me!” he gasped, hoarsely.",
        "“Quick!",
        "Who\r\ntook you to that place?”\r\n\r\nShe tried to get away, making him furious; he thought it was fear, of\r\nthe pain of his clutch—he did not understand that it was the agony of\r\nher shame.",
        "Still she answered him, “Connor.”\r\n\r\n“Connor,” he gasped.",
        "“Who is Connor?”\r\n\r\n“The boss,” she answered.",
        "“The man—”\r\n\r\nHe tightened his grip, in his frenzy, and only when he saw her eyes\r\nclosing did he realize that he was choking her.",
        "Then he relaxed his\r\nfingers, and crouched, waiting, until she opened her lids again.",
        "His\r\nbreath beat hot into her face.",
        "“Tell me,” he whispered, at last, “tell me about it.”\r\n\r\nShe lay perfectly motionless, and he had to hold his breath to catch\r\nher words.",
        "“I did not want—to do it,” she said; “I tried—I tried not to\r\ndo it.",
        "I only did it—to save us.",
        "It was our only chance.”\r\n\r\nAgain, for a space, there was no sound but his panting.",
        "Ona’s eyes\r\nclosed and when she spoke again she did not open them.",
        "“He told me—he\r\nwould have me turned off.",
        "He told me he would—we would all of us lose\r\nour places.",
        "We could never get anything to do—here—again.",
        "He—he meant\r\nit—he would have ruined us.”\r\n\r\nJurgis’ arms were shaking so that he could scarcely hold himself up,\r\nand lurched forward now and then as he listened.",
        "“When—when did this\r\nbegin?” he gasped.",
        "“At the very first,” she said.",
        "She spoke as if in a trance.",
        "“It was\r\nall—it was their plot—Miss Henderson’s plot.",
        "She hated me.",
        "And he—he\r\nwanted me.",
        "He used to speak to me—out on the platform.",
        "Then he began\r\nto—to make love to me.",
        "He offered me money.",
        "He begged me—he said he\r\nloved me.",
        "Then he threatened me.",
        "He knew all about us, he knew we would\r\nstarve.",
        "He knew your boss—he knew Marija’s.",
        "He would hound us to death,\r\nhe said—then he said if I would—if I—we would all of us be sure of\r\nwork—always.",
        "Then one day he caught hold of me—he would not let\r\ngo—he—he—”\r\n\r\n“Where was this?”\r\n\r\n“In the hallway—at night—after every one had gone.",
        "I could not help it.",
        "I thought of you—of the baby—of mother and the children.",
        "I was afraid\r\nof him—afraid to cry out.”\r\n\r\nA moment ago her face had been ashen gray, now it was scarlet.",
        "She was\r\nbeginning to breathe hard again.",
        "Jurgis made not a sound.",
        "“That was two months ago.",
        "Then he wanted me to come—to that house.",
        "He\r\nwanted me to stay there.",
        "He said all of us—that we would not have to\r\nwork.",
        "He made me come there—in the evenings.",
        "I told you—you thought I\r\nwas at the factory.",
        "Then—one night it snowed, and I couldn’t get back.",
        "And last night—the cars were stopped.",
        "It was such a little thing—to\r\nruin us all.",
        "I tried to walk, but I couldn’t.",
        "I didn’t want you to\r\nknow.",
        "It would have—it would have been all right.",
        "We could have gone\r\non—just the same—you need never have known about it.",
        "He was getting\r\ntired of me—he would have let me alone soon.",
        "I am going to have a\r\nbaby—I am getting ugly.",
        "He told me that—twice, he told me, last night.",
        "He kicked me—last night—too.",
        "And now you will kill him—you—you will\r\nkill him—and we shall die.”\r\n\r\nAll this she had said without a quiver; she lay still as death, not an\r\neyelid moving.",
        "And Jurgis, too, said not a word.",
        "He lifted himself by\r\nthe bed, and stood up.",
        "He did not stop for another glance at her, but\r\nwent to the door and opened it.",
        "He did not see Elzbieta, crouching\r\nterrified in the corner.",
        "He went out, hatless, leaving the street door\r\nopen behind him.",
        "The instant his feet were on the sidewalk he broke\r\ninto a run.",
        "He ran like one possessed, blindly, furiously, looking neither to the\r\nright nor left.",
        "He was on Ashland Avenue before exhaustion compelled\r\nhim to slow down, and then, noticing a car, he made a dart for it and\r\ndrew himself aboard.",
        "His eyes were wild and his hair flying, and he was\r\nbreathing hoarsely, like a wounded bull; but the people on the car did\r\nnot notice this particularly—perhaps it seemed natural to them that a\r\nman who smelled as Jurgis smelled should exhibit an aspect to\r\ncorrespond.",
        "They began to give way before him as usual.",
        "The conductor\r\ntook his nickel gingerly, with the tips of his fingers, and then left\r\nhim with the platform to himself.",
        "Jurgis did not even notice it—his\r\nthoughts were far away.",
        "Within his soul it was like a roaring furnace;\r\nhe stood waiting, waiting, crouching as if for a spring.",
        "He had some of his breath back when the car came to the entrance of the\r\nyards, and so he leaped off and started again, racing at full speed.",
        "People turned and stared at him, but he saw no one—there was the\r\nfactory, and he bounded through the doorway and down the corridor.",
        "He\r\nknew the room where Ona worked, and he knew Connor, the boss of the\r\nloading-gang outside.",
        "He looked for the man as he sprang into the room.",
        "The truckmen were hard at work, loading the freshly packed boxes and\r\nbarrels upon the cars.",
        "Jurgis shot one swift glance up and down the\r\nplatform—the man was not on it.",
        "But then suddenly he heard a voice in\r\nthe corridor, and started for it with a bound.",
        "In an instant more he\r\nfronted the boss.",
        "He was a big, red-faced Irishman, coarse-featured, and smelling of\r\nliquor.",
        "He saw Jurgis as he crossed the threshold, and turned white.",
        "He\r\nhesitated one second, as if meaning to run; and in the next his\r\nassailant was upon him.",
        "He put up his hands to protect his face, but\r\nJurgis, lunging with all the power of his arm and body, struck him\r\nfairly between the eyes and knocked him backward.",
        "The next moment he\r\nwas on top of him, burying his fingers in his throat.",
        "To Jurgis this man’s whole presence reeked of the crime he had\r\ncommitted; the touch of his body was madness to him—it set every nerve\r\nof him a-tremble, it aroused all the demon in his soul.",
        "It had worked\r\nits will upon Ona, this great beast—and now he had it, he had it!",
        "It\r\nwas his turn now!",
        "Things swam blood before him, and he screamed aloud\r\nin his fury, lifting his victim and smashing his head upon the floor.",
        "The place, of course, was in an uproar; women fainting and shrieking,\r\nand men rushing in.",
        "Jurgis was so bent upon his task that he knew\r\nnothing of this, and scarcely realized that people were trying to\r\ninterfere with him; it was only when half a dozen men had seized him by\r\nthe legs and shoulders and were pulling at him, that he understood that\r\nhe was losing his prey.",
        "In a flash he had bent down and sunk his teeth\r\ninto the man’s cheek; and when they tore him away he was dripping with\r\nblood, and little ribbons of skin were hanging in his mouth.",
        "They got him down upon the floor, clinging to him by his arms and legs,\r\nand still they could hardly hold him.",
        "He fought like a tiger, writhing\r\nand twisting, half flinging them off, and starting toward his\r\nunconscious enemy.",
        "But yet others rushed in, until there was a little\r\nmountain of twisted limbs and bodies, heaving and tossing, and working\r\nits way about the room.",
        "In the end, by their sheer weight, they choked\r\nthe breath out of him, and then they carried him to the company police\r\nstation, where he lay still until they had summoned a patrol wagon to\r\ntake him away.",
        "CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Jurgis got up again he went quietly enough.",
        "He was exhausted and\r\nhalf-dazed, and besides he saw the blue uniforms of the policemen.",
        "He\r\ndrove in a patrol wagon with half a dozen of them watching him; keeping\r\nas far away as possible, however, on account of the fertilizer.",
        "Then he\r\nstood before the sergeant’s desk and gave his name and address, and saw\r\na charge of assault and battery entered against him.",
        "On his way to his\r\ncell a burly policeman cursed him because he started down the wrong\r\ncorridor, and then added a kick when he was not quick enough;\r\nnevertheless, Jurgis did not even lift his eyes—he had lived two years\r\nand a half in Packingtown, and he knew what the police were.",
        "It was as\r\nmuch as a man’s very life was worth to anger them, here in their inmost\r\nlair; like as not a dozen would pile on to him at once, and pound his\r\nface into a pulp.",
        "It would be nothing unusual if he got his skull\r\ncracked in the mêlée—in which case they would report that he had been\r\ndrunk and had fallen down, and there would be no one to know the\r\ndifference or to care.",
        "So a barred door clanged upon Jurgis and he sat down upon a bench and\r\nburied his face in his hands.",
        "He was alone; he had the afternoon and\r\nall of the night to himself.",
        "At first he was like a wild beast that has glutted itself; he was in a\r\ndull stupor of satisfaction.",
        "He had done up the scoundrel pretty\r\nwell—not as well as he would have if they had given him a minute more,\r\nbut pretty well, all the same; the ends of his fingers were still\r\ntingling from their contact with the fellow’s throat.",
        "But then, little\r\nby little, as his strength came back and his senses cleared, he began\r\nto see beyond his momentary gratification; that he had nearly killed\r\nthe boss would not help Ona—not the horrors that she had borne, nor the\r\nmemory that would haunt her all her days.",
        "It would not help to feed her\r\nand her child; she would certainly lose her place, while he—what was to\r\nhappen to him God only knew.",
        "Half the night he paced the floor, wrestling with this nightmare; and\r\nwhen he was exhausted he lay down, trying to sleep, but finding\r\ninstead, for the first time in his life, that his brain was too much\r\nfor him.",
        "In the cell next to him was a drunken wife-beater and in the\r\none beyond a yelling maniac.",
        "At midnight they opened the station house\r\nto the homeless wanderers who were crowded about the door, shivering in\r\nthe winter blast, and they thronged into the corridor outside of the\r\ncells.",
        "Some of them stretched themselves out on the bare stone floor\r\nand fell to snoring, others sat up, laughing and talking, cursing and\r\nquarreling.",
        "The air was fetid with their breath, yet in spite of this\r\nsome of them smelled Jurgis and called down the torments of hell upon\r\nhim, while he lay in a far corner of his cell, counting the throbbings\r\nof the blood in his forehead.",
        "They had brought him his supper, which was “duffers and dope”—being\r\nhunks of dry bread on a tin plate, and coffee, called “dope” because it\r\nwas drugged to keep the prisoners quiet.",
        "Jurgis had not known this, or\r\nhe would have swallowed the stuff in desperation; as it was, every\r\nnerve of him was a-quiver with shame and rage.",
        "Toward morning the place\r\nfell silent, and he got up and began to pace his cell; and then within\r\nthe soul of him there rose up a fiend, red-eyed and cruel, and tore out\r\nthe strings of his heart.",
        "It was not for himself that he suffered—what did a man who worked in\r\nDurham’s fertilizer mill care about anything that the world might do to\r\nhim!",
        "What was any tyranny of prison compared with the tyranny of the\r\npast, of the thing that had happened and could not be recalled, of the\r\nmemory that could never be effaced!",
        "The horror of it drove him mad; he\r\nstretched out his arms to heaven, crying out for deliverance from\r\nit—and there was no deliverance, there was no power even in heaven that\r\ncould undo the past.",
        "It was a ghost that would not drown; it followed\r\nhim, it seized upon him and beat him to the ground.",
        "Ah, if only he\r\ncould have foreseen it—but then, he would have foreseen it, if he had\r\nnot been a fool!",
        "He smote his hands upon his forehead, cursing himself\r\nbecause he had ever allowed Ona to work where she had, because he had\r\nnot stood between her and a fate which every one knew to be so common.",
        "He should have taken her away, even if it were to lie down and die of\r\nstarvation in the gutters of Chicago’s streets!",
        "And now—oh, it could\r\nnot be true; it was too monstrous, too horrible.",
        "It was a thing that could not be faced; a new shuddering seized him\r\nevery time he tried to think of it.",
        "No, there was no bearing the load\r\nof it, there was no living under it.",
        "There would be none for her—he\r\nknew that he might pardon her, might plead with her on his knees, but\r\nshe would never look him in the face again, she would never be his wife\r\nagain.",
        "The shame of it would kill her—there could be no other\r\ndeliverance, and it was best that she should die.",
        "This was simple and clear, and yet, with cruel inconsistency, whenever\r\nhe escaped from this nightmare it was to suffer and cry out at the\r\nvision of Ona starving.",
        "They had put him in jail, and they would keep\r\nhim here a long time, years maybe.",
        "And Ona would surely not go to work\r\nagain, broken and crushed as she was.",
        "And Elzbieta and Marija, too,\r\nmight lose their places—if that hell fiend Connor chose to set to work\r\nto ruin them, they would all be turned out.",
        "And even if he did not,\r\nthey could not live—even if the boys left school again, they could\r\nsurely not pay all the bills without him and Ona.",
        "They had only a few\r\ndollars now—they had just paid the rent of the house a week ago, and\r\nthat after it was two weeks overdue.",
        "So it would be due again in a\r\nweek!",
        "They would have no money to pay it then—and they would lose the\r\nhouse, after all their long, heartbreaking struggle.",
        "Three times now\r\nthe agent had warned him that he would not tolerate another delay.",
        "Perhaps it was very base of Jurgis to be thinking about the house when\r\nhe had the other unspeakable thing to fill his mind; yet, how much he\r\nhad suffered for this house, how much they had all of them suffered!",
        "It\r\nwas their one hope of respite, as long as they lived; they had put all\r\ntheir money into it—and they were working people, poor people, whose\r\nmoney was their strength, the very substance of them, body and soul,\r\nthe thing by which they lived and for lack of which they died.",
        "And they would lose it all; they would be turned out into the streets,\r\nand have to hide in some icy garret, and live or die as best they\r\ncould!",
        "Jurgis had all the night—and all of many more nights—to think\r\nabout this, and he saw the thing in its details; he lived it all, as if\r\nhe were there.",
        "They would sell their furniture, and then run into debt\r\nat the stores, and then be refused credit; they would borrow a little\r\nfrom the Szedvilases, whose delicatessen store was tottering on the\r\nbrink of ruin; the neighbors would come and help them a little—poor,\r\nsick Jadvyga would bring a few spare pennies, as she always did when\r\npeople were starving, and Tamoszius Kuszleika would bring them the\r\nproceeds of a night’s fiddling.",
        "So they would struggle to hang on until\r\nhe got out of jail—or would they know that he was in jail, would they\r\nbe able to find out anything about him?",
        "Would they be allowed to see\r\nhim—or was it to be part of his punishment to be kept in ignorance\r\nabout their fate?",
        "His mind would hang upon the worst possibilities; he saw Ona ill and\r\ntortured, Marija out of her place, little Stanislovas unable to get to\r\nwork for the snow, the whole family turned out on the street.",
        "God\r\nAlmighty!",
        "would they actually let them lie down in the street and die?",
        "Would there be no help even then—would they wander about in the snow\r\ntill they froze?",
        "Jurgis had never seen any dead bodies in the streets,\r\nbut he had seen people evicted and disappear, no one knew where; and\r\nthough the city had a relief bureau, though there was a charity\r\norganization society in the stockyards district, in all his life there\r\nhe had never heard of either of them.",
        "They did not advertise their\r\nactivities, having more calls than they could attend to without that.",
        "—So on until morning.",
        "Then he had another ride in the patrol wagon,\r\nalong with the drunken wife-beater and the maniac, several “plain\r\ndrunks” and “saloon fighters,” a burglar, and two men who had been\r\narrested for stealing meat from the packing houses.",
        "Along with them he\r\nwas driven into a large, white-walled room, stale-smelling and crowded.",
        "In front, upon a raised platform behind a rail, sat a stout,\r\nflorid-faced personage, with a nose broken out in purple blotches.",
        "Our friend realized vaguely that he was about to be tried.",
        "He wondered\r\nwhat for—whether or not his victim might be dead, and if so, what they\r\nwould do with him.",
        "Hang him, perhaps, or beat him to death—nothing\r\nwould have surprised Jurgis, who knew little of the laws.",
        "Yet he had\r\npicked up gossip enough to have it occur to him that the loud-voiced\r\nman upon the bench might be the notorious Justice Callahan, about whom\r\nthe people of Packingtown spoke with bated breath.",
        "“Pat” Callahan—“Growler” Pat, as he had been known before he ascended\r\nthe bench—had begun life as a butcher boy and a bruiser of local\r\nreputation; he had gone into politics almost as soon as he had learned\r\nto talk, and had held two offices at once before he was old enough to\r\nvote.",
        "If Scully was the thumb, Pat Callahan was the first finger of the\r\nunseen hand whereby the packers held down the people of the district.",
        "No politician in Chicago ranked higher in their confidence; he had been\r\nat it a long time—had been the business agent in the city council of\r\nold Durham, the self-made merchant, way back in the early days, when\r\nthe whole city of Chicago had been up at auction.",
        "“Growler” Pat had\r\ngiven up holding city offices very early in his career—caring only for\r\nparty power, and giving the rest of his time to superintending his\r\ndives and brothels.",
        "Of late years, however, since his children were\r\ngrowing up, he had begun to value respectability, and had had himself\r\nmade a magistrate; a position for which he was admirably fitted,\r\nbecause of his strong conservatism and his contempt for “foreigners.”\r\n\r\nJurgis sat gazing about the room for an hour or two; he was in hopes\r\nthat some one of the family would come, but in this he was\r\ndisappointed.",
        "Finally, he was led before the bar, and a lawyer for the\r\ncompany appeared against him.",
        "Connor was under the doctor’s care, the\r\nlawyer explained briefly, and if his Honor would hold the prisoner for\r\na week—“Three hundred dollars,” said his Honor, promptly.",
        "Jurgis was staring from the judge to the lawyer in perplexity.",
        "“Have\r\nyou any one to go on your bond?” demanded the judge, and then a clerk\r\nwho stood at Jurgis’ elbow explained to him what this meant.",
        "The latter\r\nshook his head, and before he realized what had happened the policemen\r\nwere leading him away again.",
        "They took him to a room where other\r\nprisoners were waiting and here he stayed until court adjourned, when\r\nhe had another long and bitterly cold ride in a patrol wagon to the\r\ncounty jail, which is on the north side of the city, and nine or ten\r\nmiles from the stockyards.",
        "Here they searched Jurgis, leaving him only his money, which consisted\r\nof fifteen cents.",
        "Then they led him to a room and told him to strip for\r\na bath; after which he had to walk down a long gallery, past the grated\r\ncell doors of the inmates of the jail.",
        "This was a great event to the\r\nlatter—the daily review of the new arrivals, all stark naked, and many\r\nand diverting were the comments.",
        "Jurgis was required to stay in the\r\nbath longer than any one, in the vain hope of getting out of him a few\r\nof his phosphates and acids.",
        "The prisoners roomed two in a cell, but\r\nthat day there was one left over, and he was the one.",
        "The cells were in tiers, opening upon galleries.",
        "His cell was about\r\nfive feet by seven in size, with a stone floor and a heavy wooden bench\r\nbuilt into it.",
        "There was no window—the only light came from windows\r\nnear the roof at one end of the court outside.",
        "There were two bunks,\r\none above the other, each with a straw mattress and a pair of gray\r\nblankets—the latter stiff as boards with filth, and alive with fleas,\r\nbedbugs, and lice.",
        "When Jurgis lifted up the mattress he discovered\r\nbeneath it a layer of scurrying roaches, almost as badly frightened as\r\nhimself.",
        "Here they brought him more “duffers and dope,” with the addition of a\r\nbowl of soup.",
        "Many of the prisoners had their meals brought in from a\r\nrestaurant, but Jurgis had no money for that.",
        "Some had books to read\r\nand cards to play, with candles to burn by night, but Jurgis was all\r\nalone in darkness and silence.",
        "He could not sleep again; there was the\r\nsame maddening procession of thoughts that lashed him like whips upon\r\nhis naked back.",
        "When night fell he was pacing up and down his cell like\r\na wild beast that breaks its teeth upon the bars of its cage.",
        "Now and\r\nthen in his frenzy he would fling himself against the walls of the\r\nplace, beating his hands upon them.",
        "They cut him and bruised him—they\r\nwere cold and merciless as the men who had built them.",
        "In the distance there was a church-tower bell that tolled the hours one\r\nby one.",
        "When it came to midnight Jurgis was lying upon the floor with\r\nhis head in his arms, listening.",
        "Instead of falling silent at the end,\r\nthe bell broke into a sudden clangor.",
        "Jurgis raised his head; what\r\ncould that mean—a fire?",
        "God!",
        "Suppose there were to be a fire in this\r\njail!",
        "But then he made out a melody in the ringing; there were chimes.",
        "And they seemed to waken the city—all around, far and near, there were\r\nbells, ringing wild music; for fully a minute Jurgis lay lost in\r\nwonder, before, all at once, the meaning of it broke over him—that this\r\nwas Christmas Eve!",
        "Christmas Eve—he had forgotten it entirely!",
        "There was a breaking of\r\nfloodgates, a whirl of new memories and new griefs rushing into his\r\nmind.",
        "In far Lithuania they had celebrated Christmas; and it came to\r\nhim as if it had been yesterday—himself a little child, with his lost\r\nbrother and his dead father in the cabin—in the deep black forest,\r\nwhere the snow fell all day and all night and buried them from the\r\nworld.",
        "It was too far off for Santa Claus in Lithuania, but it was not\r\ntoo far for peace and good will to men, for the wonder-bearing vision\r\nof the Christ Child.",
        "And even in Packingtown they had not forgotten\r\nit—some gleam of it had never failed to break their darkness.",
        "Last\r\nChristmas Eve and all Christmas Day Jurgis had toiled on the killing\r\nbeds, and Ona at wrapping hams, and still they had found strength\r\nenough to take the children for a walk upon the avenue, to see the\r\nstore windows all decorated with Christmas trees and ablaze with\r\nelectric lights.",
        "In one window there would be live geese, in another\r\nmarvels in sugar—pink and white canes big enough for ogres, and cakes\r\nwith cherubs upon them; in a third there would be rows of fat yellow\r\nturkeys, decorated with rosettes, and rabbits and squirrels hanging; in\r\na fourth would be a fairyland of toys—lovely dolls with pink dresses,\r\nand woolly sheep and drums and soldier hats.",
        "Nor did they have to go\r\nwithout their share of all this, either.",
        "The last time they had had a\r\nbig basket with them and all their Christmas marketing to do—a roast of\r\npork and a cabbage and some rye bread, and a pair of mittens for Ona,\r\nand a rubber doll that squeaked, and a little green cornucopia full of\r\ncandy to be hung from the gas jet and gazed at by half a dozen pairs of\r\nlonging eyes.",
        "Even half a year of the sausage machines and the fertilizer mill had\r\nnot been able to kill the thought of Christmas in them; there was a\r\nchoking in Jurgis’ throat as he recalled that the very night Ona had\r\nnot come home Teta Elzbieta had taken him aside and shown him an old\r\nvalentine that she had picked up in a paper store for three cents—dingy\r\nand shopworn, but with bright colors, and figures of angels and doves.",
        "She had wiped all the specks off this, and was going to set it on the\r\nmantel, where the children could see it.",
        "Great sobs shook Jurgis at\r\nthis memory—they would spend their Christmas in misery and despair,\r\nwith him in prison and Ona ill and their home in desolation.",
        "Ah, it was\r\ntoo cruel!",
        "Why at least had they not left him alone—why, after they had\r\nshut him in jail, must they be ringing Christmas chimes in his ears!",
        "But no, their bells were not ringing for him—their Christmas was not\r\nmeant for him, they were simply not counting him at all.",
        "He was of no\r\nconsequence—he was flung aside, like a bit of trash, the carcass of\r\nsome animal.",
        "It was horrible, horrible!",
        "His wife might be dying, his\r\nbaby might be starving, his whole family might be perishing in the\r\ncold—and all the while they were ringing their Christmas chimes!",
        "And\r\nthe bitter mockery of it—all this was punishment for him!",
        "They put him\r\nin a place where the snow could not beat in, where the cold could not\r\neat through his bones; they brought him food and drink—why, in the name\r\nof heaven, if they must punish him, did they not put his family in jail\r\nand leave him outside—why could they find no better way to punish him\r\nthan to leave three weak women and six helpless children to starve and\r\nfreeze?",
        "That was their law, that was their justice!",
        "Jurgis stood upright; trembling with passion, his hands clenched and\r\nhis arms upraised, his whole soul ablaze with hatred and defiance.",
        "Ten\r\nthousand curses upon them and their law!",
        "Their justice—it was a lie, it\r\nwas a lie, a hideous, brutal lie, a thing too black and hateful for any\r\nworld but a world of nightmares.",
        "It was a sham and a loathsome mockery.",
        "There was no justice, there was no right, anywhere in it—it was only\r\nforce, it was tyranny, the will and the power, reckless and\r\nunrestrained!",
        "They had ground him beneath their heel, they had devoured\r\nall his substance; they had murdered his old father, they had broken\r\nand wrecked his wife, they had crushed and cowed his whole family; and\r\nnow they were through with him, they had no further use for him—and\r\nbecause he had interfered with them, had gotten in their way, this was\r\nwhat they had done to him!",
        "They had put him behind bars, as if he had\r\nbeen a wild beast, a thing without sense or reason, without rights,\r\nwithout affections, without feelings.",
        "Nay, they would not even have\r\ntreated a beast as they had treated him!",
        "Would any man in his senses\r\nhave trapped a wild thing in its lair, and left its young behind to\r\ndie?",
        "These midnight hours were fateful ones to Jurgis; in them was the\r\nbeginning of his rebellion, of his outlawry and his unbelief.",
        "He had no\r\nwit to trace back the social crime to its far sources—he could not say\r\nthat it was the thing men have called “the system” that was crushing\r\nhim to the earth; that it was the packers, his masters, who had bought\r\nup the law of the land, and had dealt out their brutal will to him from\r\nthe seat of justice.",
        "He only knew that he was wronged, and that the\r\nworld had wronged him; that the law, that society, with all its powers,\r\nhad declared itself his foe.",
        "And every hour his soul grew blacker,\r\nevery hour he dreamed new dreams of vengeance, of defiance, of raging,\r\nfrenzied hate.",
        "The vilest deeds, like poison weeds,\r\n    Bloom well in prison air;\r\nIt is only what is good in Man\r\n    That wastes and withers there;\r\nPale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\r\n    And the Warder is Despair.",
        "So wrote a poet, to whom the world had dealt its justice—\r\n\r\nI know not whether Laws be right,\r\n    Or whether Laws be wrong;\r\nAll that we know who lie in gaol\r\n    Is that the wall is strong.",
        "And they do well to hide their hell,\r\n    For in it things are done\r\nThat Son of God nor son of Man\r\n    Ever should look upon!",
        "CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock the next morning Jurgis was let out to get water to\r\nwash his cell—a duty which he performed faithfully, but which most of\r\nthe prisoners were accustomed to shirk, until their cells became so\r\nfilthy that the guards interposed.",
        "Then he had more “duffers and dope,”\r\nand afterward was allowed three hours for exercise, in a long,\r\ncement-walked court roofed with glass.",
        "Here were all the inmates of the\r\njail crowded together.",
        "At one side of the court was a place for\r\nvisitors, cut off by two heavy wire screens, a foot apart, so that\r\nnothing could be passed in to the prisoners; here Jurgis watched\r\nanxiously, but there came no one to see him.",
        "Soon after he went back to his cell, a keeper opened the door to let in\r\nanother prisoner.",
        "He was a dapper young fellow, with a light brown\r\nmustache and blue eyes, and a graceful figure.",
        "He nodded to Jurgis, and\r\nthen, as the keeper closed the door upon him, began gazing critically\r\nabout him.",
        "“Well, pal,” he said, as his glance encountered Jurgis again, “good\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” said Jurgis.",
        "“A rum go for Christmas, eh?” added the other.",
        "Jurgis nodded.",
        "The newcomer went to the bunks and inspected the blankets; he lifted up\r\nthe mattress, and then dropped it with an exclamation.",
        "“My God!” he\r\nsaid, “that’s the worst yet.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Jurgis again.",
        "“Looks as if it hadn’t been slept in last\r\nnight.",
        "Couldn’t stand it, eh?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t want to sleep last night,” said Jurgis.",
        "“When did you come in?”\r\n\r\n“Yesterday.”\r\n\r\nThe other had another look around, and then wrinkled up his nose.",
        "“There’s the devil of a stink in here,” he said, suddenly.",
        "“What is\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“It’s me,” said Jurgis.",
        "“You?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, me.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t they make you wash?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but this don’t wash.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Fertilizer.”\r\n\r\n“Fertilizer!",
        "The deuce!",
        "What are you?”\r\n\r\n“I work in the stockyards—at least I did until the other day.",
        "It’s in\r\nmy clothes.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a new one on me,” said the newcomer.",
        "“I thought I’d been up\r\nagainst ‘em all.",
        "What are you in for?”\r\n\r\n“I hit my boss.”\r\n\r\n“Oh—that’s it.",
        "What did he do?”\r\n\r\n“He—he treated me mean.”\r\n\r\n“I see.",
        "You’re what’s called an honest workingman!”\r\n\r\n“What are you?” Jurgis asked.",
        "“I?” The other laughed.",
        "“They say I’m a cracksman,” he said.",
        "“What’s that?” asked Jurgis.",
        "“Safes, and such things,” answered the other.",
        "“Oh,” said Jurgis, wonderingly, and stared at the speaker in awe.",
        "“You\r\nmean you break into them—you—you—”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” laughed the other, “that’s what they say.”\r\n\r\nHe did not look to be over twenty-two or three, though, as Jurgis found\r\nafterward, he was thirty.",
        "He spoke like a man of education, like what\r\nthe world calls a “gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Is that what you’re here for?” Jurgis inquired.",
        "“No,” was the answer.",
        "“I’m here for disorderly conduct.",
        "They were mad\r\nbecause they couldn’t get any evidence.",
        "“What’s your name?” the young fellow continued after a pause.",
        "“My\r\nname’s Duane—Jack Duane.",
        "I’ve more than a dozen, but that’s my company\r\none.” He seated himself on the floor with his back to the wall and his\r\nlegs crossed, and went on talking easily; he soon put Jurgis on a\r\nfriendly footing—he was evidently a man of the world, used to getting\r\non, and not too proud to hold conversation with a mere laboring man.",
        "He\r\ndrew Jurgis out, and heard all about his life all but the one\r\nunmentionable thing; and then he told stories about his own life.",
        "He\r\nwas a great one for stories, not always of the choicest.",
        "Being sent to\r\njail had apparently not disturbed his cheerfulness; he had “done time”\r\ntwice before, it seemed, and he took it all with a frolic welcome.",
        "What\r\nwith women and wine and the excitement of his vocation, a man could\r\nafford to rest now and then.",
        "Naturally, the aspect of prison life was changed for Jurgis by the\r\narrival of a cell mate.",
        "He could not turn his face to the wall and\r\nsulk, he had to speak when he was spoken to; nor could he help being\r\ninterested in the conversation of Duane—the first educated man with\r\nwhom he had ever talked.",
        "How could he help listening with wonder while\r\nthe other told of midnight ventures and perilous escapes, of feastings\r\nand orgies, of fortunes squandered in a night?",
        "The young fellow had an\r\namused contempt for Jurgis, as a sort of working mule; he, too, had\r\nfelt the world’s injustice, but instead of bearing it patiently, he had\r\nstruck back, and struck hard.",
        "He was striking all the time—there was\r\nwar between him and society.",
        "He was a genial freebooter, living off the\r\nenemy, without fear or shame.",
        "He was not always victorious, but then\r\ndefeat did not mean annihilation, and need not break his spirit.",
        "Withal he was a goodhearted fellow—too much so, it appeared.",
        "His story\r\ncame out, not in the first day, nor the second, but in the long hours\r\nthat dragged by, in which they had nothing to do but talk and nothing\r\nto talk of but themselves.",
        "Jack Duane was from the East; he was a\r\ncollege-bred man—had been studying electrical engineering.",
        "Then his\r\nfather had met with misfortune in business and killed himself; and\r\nthere had been his mother and a younger brother and sister.",
        "Also, there\r\nwas an invention of Duane’s; Jurgis could not understand it clearly,\r\nbut it had to do with telegraphing, and it was a very important\r\nthing—there were fortunes in it, millions upon millions of dollars.",
        "And\r\nDuane had been robbed of it by a great company, and got tangled up in\r\nlawsuits and lost all his money.",
        "Then somebody had given him a tip on a\r\nhorse race, and he had tried to retrieve his fortune with another\r\nperson’s money, and had to run away, and all the rest had come from\r\nthat.",
        "The other asked him what had led him to safe-breaking—to Jurgis a\r\nwild and appalling occupation to think about.",
        "A man he had met, his\r\ncell mate had replied—one thing leads to another.",
        "Didn’t he ever wonder\r\nabout his family, Jurgis asked.",
        "Sometimes, the other answered, but not\r\noften—he didn’t allow it.",
        "Thinking about it would make it no better.",
        "This wasn’t a world in which a man had any business with a family;\r\nsooner or later Jurgis would find that out also, and give up the fight\r\nand shift for himself.",
        "Jurgis was so transparently what he pretended to be that his cell mate\r\nwas as open with him as a child; it was pleasant to tell him\r\nadventures, he was so full of wonder and admiration, he was so new to\r\nthe ways of the country.",
        "Duane did not even bother to keep back names\r\nand places—he told all his triumphs and his failures, his loves and his\r\ngriefs.",
        "Also he introduced Jurgis to many of the other prisoners,\r\nnearly half of whom he knew by name.",
        "The crowd had already given Jurgis\r\na name—they called him “the stinker.” This was cruel, but they meant no\r\nharm by it, and he took it with a good-natured grin.",
        "Our friend had caught now and then a whiff from the sewers over which\r\nhe lived, but this was the first time that he had ever been splashed by\r\ntheir filth.",
        "This jail was a Noah’s ark of the city’s crime—there were\r\nmurderers, “hold-up men” and burglars, embezzlers, counterfeiters and\r\nforgers, bigamists, “shoplifters,” “confidence men,” petty thieves and\r\npickpockets, gamblers and procurers, brawlers, beggars, tramps and\r\ndrunkards; they were black and white, old and young, Americans and\r\nnatives of every nation under the sun.",
        "There were hardened criminals\r\nand innocent men too poor to give bail; old men, and boys literally not\r\nyet in their teens.",
        "They were the drainage of the great festering ulcer\r\nof society; they were hideous to look upon, sickening to talk to.",
        "All\r\nlife had turned to rottenness and stench in them—love was a\r\nbeastliness, joy was a snare, and God was an imprecation.",
        "They strolled\r\nhere and there about the courtyard, and Jurgis listened to them.",
        "He was\r\nignorant and they were wise; they had been everywhere and tried\r\neverything.",
        "They could tell the whole hateful story of it, set forth\r\nthe inner soul of a city in which justice and honor, women’s bodies and\r\nmen’s souls, were for sale in the marketplace, and human beings writhed\r\nand fought and fell upon each other like wolves in a pit; in which\r\nlusts were raging fires, and men were fuel, and humanity was festering\r\nand stewing and wallowing in its own corruption.",
        "Into this wild-beast\r\ntangle these men had been born without their consent, they had taken\r\npart in it because they could not help it; that they were in jail was\r\nno disgrace to them, for the game had never been fair, the dice were\r\nloaded.",
        "They were swindlers and thieves of pennies and dimes, and they\r\nhad been trapped and put out of the way by the swindlers and thieves of\r\nmillions of dollars.",
        "To most of this Jurgis tried not to listen.",
        "They frightened him with\r\ntheir savage mockery; and all the while his heart was far away, where\r\nhis loved ones were calling.",
        "Now and then in the midst of it his\r\nthoughts would take flight; and then the tears would come into his\r\neyes—and he would be called back by the jeering laughter of his\r\ncompanions.",
        "He spent a week in this company, and during all that time he had no\r\nword from his home.",
        "He paid one of his fifteen cents for a postal card,\r\nand his companion wrote a note to the family, telling them where he was\r\nand when he would be tried.",
        "There came no answer to it, however, and at\r\nlast, the day before New Year’s, Jurgis bade good-by to Jack Duane.",
        "The\r\nlatter gave him his address, or rather the address of his mistress, and\r\nmade Jurgis promise to look him up.",
        "“Maybe I could help you out of a\r\nhole some day,” he said, and added that he was sorry to have him go.",
        "Jurgis rode in the patrol wagon back to Justice Callahan’s court for\r\ntrial.",
        "One of the first things he made out as he entered the room was Teta\r\nElzbieta and little Kotrina, looking pale and frightened, seated far in\r\nthe rear.",
        "His heart began to pound, but he did not dare to try to\r\nsignal to them, and neither did Elzbieta.",
        "He took his seat in the\r\nprisoners’ pen and sat gazing at them in helpless agony.",
        "He saw that\r\nOna was not with them, and was full of foreboding as to what that might\r\nmean.",
        "He spent half an hour brooding over this—and then suddenly he\r\nstraightened up and the blood rushed into his face.",
        "A man had come\r\nin—Jurgis could not see his features for the bandages that swathed him,\r\nbut he knew the burly figure.",
        "It was Connor!",
        "A trembling seized him,\r\nand his limbs bent as if for a spring.",
        "Then suddenly he felt a hand on\r\nhis collar, and heard a voice behind him: “Sit down, you son of a—!”\r\n\r\nHe subsided, but he never took his eyes off his enemy.",
        "The fellow was\r\nstill alive, which was a disappointment, in one way; and yet it was\r\npleasant to see him, all in penitential plasters.",
        "He and the company\r\nlawyer, who was with him, came and took seats within the judge’s\r\nrailing; and a minute later the clerk called Jurgis’ name, and the\r\npoliceman jerked him to his feet and led him before the bar, gripping\r\nhim tightly by the arm, lest he should spring upon the boss.",
        "Jurgis listened while the man entered the witness chair, took the oath,\r\nand told his story.",
        "The wife of the prisoner had been employed in a\r\ndepartment near him, and had been discharged for impudence to him.",
        "Half\r\nan hour later he had been violently attacked, knocked down, and almost\r\nchoked to death.",
        "He had brought witnesses—\r\n\r\n“They will probably not be necessary,” observed the judge and he turned\r\nto Jurgis.",
        "“You admit attacking the plaintiff?” he asked.",
        "“Him?” inquired Jurgis, pointing at the boss.",
        "“Yes,” said the judge.",
        "“I hit him, sir,” said Jurgis.",
        "“Say ‘your Honor,’” said the officer, pinching his arm hard.",
        "“Your Honor,” said Jurgis, obediently.",
        "“You tried to choke him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, your Honor.”\r\n\r\n“Ever been arrested before?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, your Honor.”\r\n\r\n“What have you to say for yourself?”\r\n\r\nJurgis hesitated.",
        "What had he to say?",
        "In two years and a half he had\r\nlearned to speak English for practical purposes, but these had never\r\nincluded the statement that some one had intimidated and seduced his\r\nwife.",
        "He tried once or twice, stammering and balking, to the annoyance\r\nof the judge, who was gasping from the odor of fertilizer.",
        "Finally, the\r\nprisoner made it understood that his vocabulary was inadequate, and\r\nthere stepped up a dapper young man with waxed mustaches, bidding him\r\nspeak in any language he knew.",
        "Jurgis began; supposing that he would be given time, he explained how\r\nthe boss had taken advantage of his wife’s position to make advances to\r\nher and had threatened her with the loss of her place.",
        "When the\r\ninterpreter had translated this, the judge, whose calendar was crowded,\r\nand whose automobile was ordered for a certain hour, interrupted with\r\nthe remark: “Oh, I see.",
        "Well, if he made love to your wife, why didn’t\r\nshe complain to the superintendent or leave the place?”\r\n\r\nJurgis hesitated, somewhat taken aback; he began to explain that they\r\nwere very poor—that work was hard to get—\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Justice Callahan; “so instead you thought you would knock\r\nhim down.” He turned to the plaintiff, inquiring, “Is there any truth\r\nin this story, Mr.",
        "Connor?”\r\n\r\n“Not a particle, your Honor,” said the boss.",
        "“It is very\r\nunpleasant—they tell some such tale every time you have to discharge a\r\nwoman—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” said the judge.",
        "“I hear it often enough.",
        "The fellow\r\nseems to have handled you pretty roughly.",
        "Thirty days and costs.",
        "Next\r\ncase.”\r\n\r\nJurgis had been listening in perplexity.",
        "It was only when the policeman\r\nwho had him by the arm turned and started to lead him away that he\r\nrealized that sentence had been passed.",
        "He gazed round him wildly.",
        "“Thirty days!” he panted and then he whirled upon the judge.",
        "“What will\r\nmy family do?” he cried frantically.",
        "“I have a wife and baby, sir, and\r\nthey have no money—my God, they will starve to death!”\r\n\r\n“You would have done well to think about them before you committed the\r\nassault,” said the judge dryly, as he turned to look at the next\r\nprisoner.",
        "Jurgis would have spoken again, but the policeman had seized him by the\r\ncollar and was twisting it, and a second policeman was making for him\r\nwith evidently hostile intentions.",
        "So he let them lead him away.",
        "Far\r\ndown the room he saw Elzbieta and Kotrina, risen from their seats,\r\nstaring in fright; he made one effort to go to them, and then, brought\r\nback by another twist at his throat, he bowed his head and gave up the\r\nstruggle.",
        "They thrust him into a cell room, where other prisoners were\r\nwaiting; and as soon as court had adjourned they led him down with them\r\ninto the “Black Maria,” and drove him away.",
        "This time Jurgis was bound for the “Bridewell,” a petty jail where Cook\r\nCounty prisoners serve their time.",
        "It was even filthier and more\r\ncrowded than the county jail; all the smaller fry out of the latter had\r\nbeen sifted into it—the petty thieves and swindlers, the brawlers and\r\nvagrants.",
        "For his cell mate Jurgis had an Italian fruit seller who had\r\nrefused to pay his graft to the policeman, and been arrested for\r\ncarrying a large pocketknife; as he did not understand a word of\r\nEnglish our friend was glad when he left.",
        "He gave place to a Norwegian\r\nsailor, who had lost half an ear in a drunken brawl, and who proved to\r\nbe quarrelsome, cursing Jurgis because he moved in his bunk and caused\r\nthe roaches to drop upon the lower one.",
        "It would have been quite\r\nintolerable, staying in a cell with this wild beast, but for the fact\r\nthat all day long the prisoners were put at work breaking stone.",
        "Ten days of his thirty Jurgis spent thus, without hearing a word from\r\nhis family; then one day a keeper came and informed him that there was\r\na visitor to see him.",
        "Jurgis turned white, and so weak at the knees\r\nthat he could hardly leave his cell.",
        "The man led him down the corridor and a flight of steps to the\r\nvisitors’ room, which was barred like a cell.",
        "Through the grating\r\nJurgis could see some one sitting in a chair; and as he came into the\r\nroom the person started up, and he saw that it was little Stanislovas.",
        "At the sight of some one from home the big fellow nearly went to\r\npieces—he had to steady himself by a chair, and he put his other hand\r\nto his forehead, as if to clear away a mist.",
        "“Well?” he said, weakly.",
        "Little Stanislovas was also trembling, and all but too frightened to\r\nspeak.",
        "“They—they sent me to tell you—” he said, with a gulp.",
        "“Well?” Jurgis repeated.",
        "He followed the boy’s glance to where the\r\nkeeper was standing watching them.",
        "“Never mind that,” Jurgis cried,\r\nwildly.",
        "“How are they?”\r\n\r\n“Ona is very sick,” Stanislovas said; “and we are almost starving.",
        "We\r\ncan’t get along; we thought you might be able to help us.”\r\n\r\nJurgis gripped the chair tighter; there were beads of perspiration on\r\nhis forehead, and his hand shook.",
        "“I—can’t help you,” he said.",
        "“Ona lies in her room all day,” the boy went on, breathlessly.",
        "“She\r\nwon’t eat anything, and she cries all the time.",
        "She won’t tell what is\r\nthe matter and she won’t go to work at all.",
        "Then a long time ago the\r\nman came for the rent.",
        "He was very cross.",
        "He came again last week.",
        "He\r\nsaid he would turn us out of the house.",
        "And then Marija—”\r\n\r\nA sob choked Stanislovas, and he stopped.",
        "“What’s the matter with\r\nMarija?” cried Jurgis.",
        "“She’s cut her hand!” said the boy.",
        "“She’s cut it bad, this time, worse\r\nthan before.",
        "She can’t work and it’s all turning green, and the company\r\ndoctor says she may—she may have to have it cut off.",
        "And Marija cries\r\nall the time—her money is nearly all gone, too, and we can’t pay the\r\nrent and the interest on the house; and we have no coal and nothing\r\nmore to eat, and the man at the store, he says—”\r\n\r\nThe little fellow stopped again, beginning to whimper.",
        "“Go on!” the\r\nother panted in frenzy—“Go on!”\r\n\r\n“I—I will,” sobbed Stanislovas.",
        "“It’s so—so cold all the time.",
        "And last\r\nSunday it snowed again—a deep, deep snow—and I couldn’t—couldn’t get to\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n“God!” Jurgis half shouted, and he took a step toward the child.",
        "There\r\nwas an old hatred between them because of the snow—ever since that\r\ndreadful morning when the boy had had his fingers frozen and Jurgis had\r\nhad to beat him to send him to work.",
        "Now he clenched his hands, looking\r\nas if he would try to break through the grating.",
        "“You little villain,”\r\nhe cried, “you didn’t try!”\r\n\r\n“I did—I did!” wailed Stanislovas, shrinking from him in terror.",
        "“I\r\ntried all day—two days.",
        "Elzbieta was with me, and she couldn’t either.",
        "We couldn’t walk at all, it was so deep.",
        "And we had nothing to eat, and\r\noh, it was so cold!",
        "I tried, and then the third day Ona went with me—”\r\n\r\n“Ona!”\r\n\r\n“Yes.",
        "She tried to get to work, too.",
        "She had to.",
        "We were all starving.",
        "But she had lost her place—”\r\n\r\nJurgis reeled, and gave a gasp.",
        "“She went back to that place?” he\r\nscreamed.",
        "“She tried to,” said Stanislovas, gazing at him in\r\nperplexity.",
        "“Why not, Jurgis?”\r\n\r\nThe man breathed hard, three or four times.",
        "“Go—on,” he panted,\r\nfinally.",
        "“I went with her,” said Stanislovas, “but Miss Henderson wouldn’t take\r\nher back.",
        "And Connor saw her and cursed her.",
        "He was still bandaged\r\nup—why did you hit him, Jurgis?” (There was some fascinating mystery\r\nabout this, the little fellow knew; but he could get no satisfaction.)\r\n\r\nJurgis could not speak; he could only stare, his eyes starting out.",
        "“She has been trying to get other work,” the boy went on; “but she’s so\r\nweak she can’t keep up.",
        "And my boss would not take me back, either—Ona\r\nsays he knows Connor, and that’s the reason; they’ve all got a grudge\r\nagainst us now.",
        "So I’ve got to go downtown and sell papers with the\r\nrest of the boys and Kotrina—”\r\n\r\n“Kotrina!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she’s been selling papers, too.",
        "She does best, because she’s a\r\ngirl.",
        "Only the cold is so bad—it’s terrible coming home at night,\r\nJurgis.",
        "Sometimes they can’t come home at all—I’m going to try to find\r\nthem tonight and sleep where they do, it’s so late and it’s such a long\r\nways home.",
        "I’ve had to walk, and I didn’t know where it was—I don’t\r\nknow how to get back, either.",
        "Only mother said I must come, because you\r\nwould want to know, and maybe somebody would help your family when they\r\nhad put you in jail so you couldn’t work.",
        "And I walked all day to get\r\nhere—and I only had a piece of bread for breakfast, Jurgis.",
        "Mother\r\nhasn’t any work either, because the sausage department is shut down;\r\nand she goes and begs at houses with a basket, and people give her\r\nfood.",
        "Only she didn’t get much yesterday; it was too cold for her\r\nfingers, and today she was crying—”\r\n\r\nSo little Stanislovas went on, sobbing as he talked; and Jurgis stood,\r\ngripping the table tightly, saying not a word, but feeling that his\r\nhead would burst; it was like having weights piled upon him, one after\r\nanother, crushing the life out of him.",
        "He struggled and fought within\r\nhimself—as if in some terrible nightmare, in which a man suffers an\r\nagony, and cannot lift his hand, nor cry out, but feels that he is\r\ngoing mad, that his brain is on fire—\r\n\r\nJust when it seemed to him that another turn of the screw would kill\r\nhim, little Stanislovas stopped.",
        "“You cannot help us?” he said weakly.",
        "Jurgis shook his head.",
        "“They won’t give you anything here?”\r\n\r\nHe shook it again.",
        "“When are you coming out?”\r\n\r\n“Three weeks yet,” Jurgis answered.",
        "And the boy gazed around him uncertainly.",
        "“Then I might as well go,” he\r\nsaid.",
        "Jurgis nodded.",
        "Then, suddenly recollecting, he put his hand into his\r\npocket and drew it out, shaking.",
        "“Here,” he said, holding out the\r\nfourteen cents.",
        "“Take this to them.”\r\n\r\nAnd Stanislovas took it, and after a little more hesitation, started\r\nfor the door.",
        "“Good-by, Jurgis,” he said, and the other noticed that he\r\nwalked unsteadily as he passed out of sight.",
        "For a minute or so Jurgis stood clinging to his chair, reeling and\r\nswaying; then the keeper touched him on the arm, and he turned and went\r\nback to breaking stone.",
        "CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis did not get out of the Bridewell quite as soon as he had\r\nexpected.",
        "To his sentence there were added “court costs” of a dollar\r\nand a half—he was supposed to pay for the trouble of putting him in\r\njail, and not having the money, was obliged to work it off by three\r\ndays more of toil.",
        "Nobody had taken the trouble to tell him this—only\r\nafter counting the days and looking forward to the end in an agony of\r\nimpatience, when the hour came that he expected to be free he found\r\nhimself still set at the stone heap, and laughed at when he ventured to\r\nprotest.",
        "Then he concluded he must have counted wrong; but as another\r\nday passed, he gave up all hope—and was sunk in the depths of despair,\r\nwhen one morning after breakfast a keeper came to him with the word\r\nthat his time was up at last.",
        "So he doffed his prison garb, and put on\r\nhis old fertilizer clothing, and heard the door of the prison clang\r\nbehind him.",
        "He stood upon the steps, bewildered; he could hardly believe that it\r\nwas true,—that the sky was above him again and the open street before\r\nhim; that he was a free man.",
        "But then the cold began to strike through\r\nhis clothes, and he started quickly away.",
        "There had been a heavy snow, and now a thaw had set in; fine sleety\r\nrain was falling, driven by a wind that pierced Jurgis to the bone.",
        "He\r\nhad not stopped for his-overcoat when he set out to “do up” Connor, and\r\nso his rides in the patrol wagons had been cruel experiences; his\r\nclothing was old and worn thin, and it never had been very warm.",
        "Now as\r\nhe trudged on the rain soon wet it through; there were six inches of\r\nwatery slush on the sidewalks, so that his feet would soon have been\r\nsoaked, even had there been no holes in his shoes.",
        "Jurgis had had enough to eat in the jail, and the work had been the\r\nleast trying of any that he had done since he came to Chicago; but even\r\nso, he had not grown strong—the fear and grief that had preyed upon his\r\nmind had worn him thin.",
        "Now he shivered and shrunk from the rain,\r\nhiding his hands in his pockets and hunching his shoulders together.",
        "The Bridewell grounds were on the outskirts of the city and the country\r\naround them was unsettled and wild—on one side was the big drainage\r\ncanal, and on the other a maze of railroad tracks, and so the wind had\r\nfull sweep.",
        "After walking a ways, Jurgis met a little ragamuffin whom he hailed:\r\n“Hey, sonny!” The boy cocked one eye at him—he knew that Jurgis was a\r\n“jailbird” by his shaven head.",
        "“Wot yer want?” he queried.",
        "“How do you go to the stockyards?” Jurgis demanded.",
        "“I don’t go,” replied the boy.",
        "Jurgis hesitated a moment, nonplussed.",
        "Then he said, “I mean which is\r\nthe way?”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t yer say so then?” was the response, and the boy pointed to\r\nthe northwest, across the tracks.",
        "“That way.”\r\n\r\n“How far is it?” Jurgis asked.",
        "“I dunno,” said the other.",
        "“Mebbe twenty\r\nmiles or so.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty miles!” Jurgis echoed, and his face fell.",
        "He had to walk every\r\nfoot of it, for they had turned him out of jail without a penny in his\r\npockets.",
        "Yet, when he once got started, and his blood had warmed with walking,\r\nhe forgot everything in the fever of his thoughts.",
        "All the dreadful\r\nimaginations that had haunted him in his cell now rushed into his mind\r\nat once.",
        "The agony was almost over—he was going to find out; and he\r\nclenched his hands in his pockets as he strode, following his flying\r\ndesire, almost at a run.",
        "Ona—the baby—the family—the house—he would\r\nknow the truth about them all!",
        "And he was coming to the rescue—he was\r\nfree again!",
        "His hands were his own, and he could help them, he could do\r\nbattle for them against the world.",
        "For an hour or so he walked thus, and then he began to look about him.",
        "He seemed to be leaving the city altogether.",
        "The street was turning\r\ninto a country road, leading out to the westward; there were\r\nsnow-covered fields on either side of him.",
        "Soon he met a farmer driving\r\na two-horse wagon loaded with straw, and he stopped him.",
        "“Is this the way to the stockyards?” he asked.",
        "The farmer scratched his head.",
        "“I dunno jest where they be,” he said.",
        "“But they’re in the city somewhere, and you’re going dead away from it\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nJurgis looked dazed.",
        "“I was told this was the way,” he said.",
        "“Who told you?”\r\n\r\n“A boy.”\r\n\r\n“Well, mebbe he was playing a joke on ye.",
        "The best thing ye kin do is\r\nto go back, and when ye git into town ask a policeman.",
        "I’d take ye in,\r\nonly I’ve come a long ways an’ I’m loaded heavy.",
        "Git up!”\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis turned and followed, and toward the end of the morning he\r\nbegan to see Chicago again.",
        "Past endless blocks of two-story shanties\r\nhe walked, along wooden sidewalks and unpaved pathways treacherous with\r\ndeep slush holes.",
        "Every few blocks there would be a railroad crossing\r\non the level with the sidewalk, a deathtrap for the unwary; long\r\nfreight trains would be passing, the cars clanking and crashing\r\ntogether, and Jurgis would pace about waiting, burning up with a fever\r\nof impatience.",
        "Occasionally the cars would stop for some minutes, and\r\nwagons and streetcars would crowd together waiting, the drivers\r\nswearing at each other, or hiding beneath umbrellas out of the rain; at\r\nsuch times Jurgis would dodge under the gates and run across the tracks\r\nand between the cars, taking his life into his hands.",
        "He crossed a long bridge over a river frozen solid and covered with\r\nslush.",
        "Not even on the river bank was the snow white—the rain which\r\nfell was a diluted solution of smoke, and Jurgis’ hands and face were\r\nstreaked with black.",
        "Then he came into the business part of the city,\r\nwhere the streets were sewers of inky blackness, with horses sleeping\r\nand plunging, and women and children flying across in panic-stricken\r\ndroves.",
        "These streets were huge canyons formed by towering black\r\nbuildings, echoing with the clang of car gongs and the shouts of\r\ndrivers; the people who swarmed in them were as busy as ants—all\r\nhurrying breathlessly, never stopping to look at anything nor at each\r\nother.",
        "The solitary trampish-looking foreigner, with water-soaked\r\nclothing and haggard face and anxious eyes, was as much alone as he\r\nhurried past them, as much unheeded and as lost, as if he had been a\r\nthousand miles deep in a wilderness.",
        "A policeman gave him his direction and told him that he had five miles\r\nto go.",
        "He came again to the slum districts, to avenues of saloons and\r\ncheap stores, with long dingy red factory buildings, and coal-yards and\r\nrailroad tracks; and then Jurgis lifted up his head and began to sniff\r\nthe air like a startled animal—scenting the far-off odor of home.",
        "It\r\nwas late afternoon then, and he was hungry, but the dinner invitations\r\nhung out of the saloons were not for him.",
        "So he came at last to the stockyards, to the black volcanoes of smoke\r\nand the lowing cattle and the stench.",
        "Then, seeing a crowded car, his\r\nimpatience got the better of him and he jumped aboard, hiding behind\r\nanother man, unnoticed by the conductor.",
        "In ten minutes more he had\r\nreached his street, and home.",
        "He was half running as he came round the corner.",
        "There was the house,\r\nat any rate—and then suddenly he stopped and stared.",
        "What was the\r\nmatter with the house?",
        "Jurgis looked twice, bewildered; then he glanced at the house next door\r\nand at the one beyond—then at the saloon on the corner.",
        "Yes, it was the\r\nright place, quite certainly—he had not made any mistake.",
        "But the\r\nhouse—the house was a different color!",
        "He came a couple of steps nearer.",
        "Yes; it had been gray and now it was\r\nyellow!",
        "The trimmings around the windows had been red, and now they\r\nwere green!",
        "It was all newly painted!",
        "How strange it made it seem!",
        "Jurgis went closer yet, but keeping on the other side of the street.",
        "A\r\nsudden and horrible spasm of fear had come over him.",
        "His knees were\r\nshaking beneath him, and his mind was in a whirl.",
        "New paint on the\r\nhouse, and new weatherboards, where the old had begun to rot off, and\r\nthe agent had got after them!",
        "New shingles over the hole in the roof,\r\ntoo, the hole that had for six months been the bane of his soul—he\r\nhaving no money to have it fixed and no time to fix it himself, and the\r\nrain leaking in, and overflowing the pots and pans he put to catch it,\r\nand flooding the attic and loosening the plaster.",
        "And now it was fixed!",
        "And the broken windowpane replaced!",
        "And curtains in the windows!",
        "New,\r\nwhite curtains, stiff and shiny!",
        "Then suddenly the front door opened.",
        "Jurgis stood, his chest heaving as\r\nhe struggled to catch his breath.",
        "A boy had come out, a stranger to\r\nhim; a big, fat, rosy-cheeked youngster, such as had never been seen in\r\nhis home before.",
        "Jurgis stared at the boy, fascinated.",
        "He came down the steps whistling,\r\nkicking off the snow.",
        "He stopped at the foot, and picked up some, and\r\nthen leaned against the railing, making a snowball.",
        "A moment later he\r\nlooked around and saw Jurgis, and their eyes met; it was a hostile\r\nglance, the boy evidently thinking that the other had suspicions of the\r\nsnowball.",
        "When Jurgis started slowly across the street toward him, he\r\ngave a quick glance about, meditating retreat, but then he concluded to\r\nstand his ground.",
        "Jurgis took hold of the railing of the steps, for he was a little\r\nunsteady.",
        "“What—what are you doing here?” he managed to gasp.",
        "“Go on!” said the boy.",
        "“You—” Jurgis tried again.",
        "“What do you want here?”\r\n\r\n“Me?” answered the boy, angrily.",
        "“I live here.”\r\n\r\n“You live here!” Jurgis panted.",
        "He turned white and clung more tightly\r\nto the railing.",
        "“You live here!",
        "Then where’s my family?”\r\n\r\nThe boy looked surprised.",
        "“Your family!” he echoed.",
        "And Jurgis started toward him.",
        "“I—this is my house!” he cried.",
        "“Come off!” said the boy; then suddenly the door upstairs opened, and\r\nhe called: “Hey, ma!",
        "Here’s a fellow says he owns this house.”\r\n\r\nA stout Irishwoman came to the top of the steps.",
        "“What’s that?” she\r\ndemanded.",
        "Jurgis turned toward her.",
        "“Where is my family?” he cried, wildly.",
        "“I\r\nleft them here!",
        "This is my home!",
        "What are you doing in my home?”\r\n\r\nThe woman stared at him in frightened wonder, she must have thought she\r\nwas dealing with a maniac—Jurgis looked like one.",
        "“Your home!” she\r\nechoed.",
        "“My home!” he half shrieked.",
        "“I lived here, I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“You must be mistaken,” she answered him.",
        "“No one ever lived here.",
        "This\r\nis a new house.",
        "They told us so.",
        "They—”\r\n\r\n“What have they done with my family?” shouted Jurgis, frantically.",
        "A light had begun to break upon the woman; perhaps she had had doubts\r\nof what “they” had told her.",
        "“I don’t know where your family is,” she\r\nsaid.",
        "“I bought the house only three days ago, and there was nobody\r\nhere, and they told me it was all new.",
        "Do you really mean you had ever\r\nrented it?”\r\n\r\n“Rented it!” panted Jurgis.",
        "“I bought it!",
        "I paid for it!",
        "I own it!",
        "And\r\nthey—my God, can’t you tell me where my people went?”\r\n\r\nShe made him understand at last that she knew nothing.",
        "Jurgis’ brain\r\nwas so confused that he could not grasp the situation.",
        "It was as if his\r\nfamily had been wiped out of existence; as if they were proving to be\r\ndream people, who never had existed at all.",
        "He was quite lost—but then\r\nsuddenly he thought of Grandmother Majauszkiene, who lived in the next\r\nblock.",
        "She would know!",
        "He turned and started at a run.",
        "Grandmother Majauszkiene came to the door herself.",
        "She cried out when\r\nshe saw Jurgis, wild-eyed and shaking.",
        "Yes, yes, she could tell him.",
        "The family had moved; they had not been able to pay the rent and they\r\nhad been turned out into the snow, and the house had been repainted and\r\nsold again the next week.",
        "No, she had not heard how they were, but she\r\ncould tell him that they had gone back to Aniele Jukniene, with whom\r\nthey had stayed when they first came to the yards.",
        "Wouldn’t Jurgis come\r\nin and rest?",
        "It was certainly too bad—if only he had not got into jail—\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis turned and staggered away.",
        "He did not go very far round\r\nthe corner he gave out completely, and sat down on the steps of a\r\nsaloon, and hid his face in his hands, and shook all over with dry,\r\nracking sobs.",
        "Their home!",
        "Their home!",
        "They had lost it!",
        "Grief, despair, rage,\r\noverwhelmed him—what was any imagination of the thing to this\r\nheartbreaking, crushing reality of it—to the sight of strange people\r\nliving in his house, hanging their curtains to his windows, staring at\r\nhim with hostile eyes!",
        "It was monstrous, it was unthinkable—they could\r\nnot do it—it could not be true!",
        "Only think what he had suffered for\r\nthat house—what miseries they had all suffered for it—the price they\r\nhad paid for it!",
        "The whole long agony came back to him.",
        "Their sacrifices in the\r\nbeginning, their three hundred dollars that they had scraped together,\r\nall they owned in the world, all that stood between them and\r\nstarvation!",
        "And then their toil, month by month, to get together the\r\ntwelve dollars, and the interest as well, and now and then the taxes,\r\nand the other charges, and the repairs, and what not!",
        "Why, they had put\r\ntheir very souls into their payments on that house, they had paid for\r\nit with their sweat and tears—yes, more, with their very lifeblood.",
        "Dede Antanas had died of the struggle to earn that money—he would have\r\nbeen alive and strong today if he had not had to work in Durham’s dark\r\ncellars to earn his share.",
        "And Ona, too, had given her health and\r\nstrength to pay for it—she was wrecked and ruined because of it; and so\r\nwas he, who had been a big, strong man three years ago, and now sat\r\nhere shivering, broken, cowed, weeping like a hysterical child.",
        "Ah!",
        "they had cast their all into the fight; and they had lost, they had\r\nlost!",
        "All that they had paid was gone—every cent of it.",
        "And their house\r\nwas gone—they were back where they had started from, flung out into the\r\ncold to starve and freeze!",
        "Jurgis could see all the truth now—could see himself, through the whole\r\nlong course of events, the victim of ravenous vultures that had torn\r\ninto his vitals and devoured him; of fiends that had racked and\r\ntortured him, mocking him, meantime, jeering in his face.",
        "Ah, God, the\r\nhorror of it, the monstrous, hideous, demoniacal wickedness of it!",
        "He\r\nand his family, helpless women and children, struggling to live,\r\nignorant and defenseless and forlorn as they were—and the enemies that\r\nhad been lurking for them, crouching upon their trail and thirsting for\r\ntheir blood!",
        "That first lying circular, that smooth-tongued slippery\r\nagent!",
        "That trap of the extra payments, the interest, and all the other\r\ncharges that they had not the means to pay, and would never have\r\nattempted to pay!",
        "And then all the tricks of the packers, their\r\nmasters, the tyrants who ruled them—the shutdowns and the scarcity of\r\nwork, the irregular hours and the cruel speeding-up, the lowering of\r\nwages, the raising of prices!",
        "The mercilessness of nature about them,\r\nof heat and cold, rain and snow; the mercilessness of the city, of the\r\ncountry in which they lived, of its laws and customs that they did not\r\nunderstand!",
        "All of these things had worked together for the company\r\nthat had marked them for its prey and was waiting for its chance.",
        "And\r\nnow, with this last hideous injustice, its time had come, and it had\r\nturned them out bag and baggage, and taken their house and sold it\r\nagain!",
        "And they could do nothing, they were tied hand and foot—the law\r\nwas against them, the whole machinery of society was at their\r\noppressors’ command!",
        "If Jurgis so much as raised a hand against them,\r\nback he would go into that wild-beast pen from which he had just\r\nescaped!",
        "To get up and go away was to give up, to acknowledge defeat, to leave\r\nthe strange family in possession; and Jurgis might have sat shivering\r\nin the rain for hours before he could do that, had it not been for the\r\nthought of his family.",
        "It might be that he had worse things yet to\r\nlearn—and so he got to his feet and started away, walking on, wearily,\r\nhalf-dazed.",
        "To Aniele’s house, in back of the yards, was a good two miles; the\r\ndistance had never seemed longer to Jurgis, and when he saw the\r\nfamiliar dingy-gray shanty his heart was beating fast.",
        "He ran up the\r\nsteps and began to hammer upon the door.",
        "The old woman herself came to open it.",
        "She had shrunk all up with her\r\nrheumatism since Jurgis had seen her last, and her yellow parchment\r\nface stared up at him from a little above the level of the doorknob.",
        "She gave a start when she saw him.",
        "“Is Ona here?” he cried,\r\nbreathlessly.",
        "“Yes,” was the answer, “she’s here.”\r\n\r\n“How—” Jurgis began, and then stopped short, clutching convulsively at\r\nthe side of the door.",
        "From somewhere within the house had come a sudden\r\ncry, a wild, horrible scream of anguish.",
        "And the voice was Ona’s.",
        "For a\r\nmoment Jurgis stood half-paralyzed with fright; then he bounded past\r\nthe old woman and into the room.",
        "It was Aniele’s kitchen, and huddled round the stove were half a dozen\r\nwomen, pale and frightened.",
        "One of them started to her feet as Jurgis\r\nentered; she was haggard and frightfully thin, with one arm tied up in\r\nbandages—he hardly realized that it was Marija.",
        "He looked first for\r\nOna; then, not seeing her, he stared at the women, expecting them to\r\nspeak.",
        "But they sat dumb, gazing back at him, panic-stricken; and a\r\nsecond later came another piercing scream.",
        "It was from the rear of the house, and upstairs.",
        "Jurgis bounded to a\r\ndoor of the room and flung it open; there was a ladder leading through\r\na trap door to the garret, and he was at the foot of it when suddenly\r\nhe heard a voice behind him, and saw Marija at his heels.",
        "She seized\r\nhim by the sleeve with her good hand, panting wildly, “No, no, Jurgis!",
        "Stop!”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” he gasped.",
        "“You mustn’t go up,” she cried.",
        "Jurgis was half-crazed with bewilderment and fright.",
        "“What’s the\r\nmatter?” he shouted.",
        "“What is it?”\r\n\r\nMarija clung to him tightly; he could hear Ona sobbing and moaning\r\nabove, and he fought to get away and climb up, without waiting for her\r\nreply.",
        "“No, no,” she rushed on.",
        "“Jurgis!",
        "You mustn’t go up!",
        "It’s—it’s\r\nthe child!”\r\n\r\n“The child?” he echoed in perplexity.",
        "“Antanas?”\r\n\r\nMarija answered him, in a whisper: “The new one!”\r\n\r\nAnd then Jurgis went limp, and caught himself on the ladder.",
        "He stared\r\nat her as if she were a ghost.",
        "“The new one!” he gasped.",
        "“But it isn’t\r\ntime,” he added, wildly.",
        "Marija nodded.",
        "“I know,” she said; “but it’s come.”\r\n\r\nAnd then again came Ona’s scream, smiting him like a blow in the face,\r\nmaking him wince and turn white.",
        "Her voice died away into a wail—then\r\nhe heard her sobbing again, “My God—let me die, let me die!” And Marija\r\nhung her arms about him, crying: “Come out!",
        "Come away!”\r\n\r\nShe dragged him back into the kitchen, half carrying him, for he had\r\ngone all to pieces.",
        "It was as if the pillars of his soul had fallen\r\nin—he was blasted with horror.",
        "In the room he sank into a chair,\r\ntrembling like a leaf, Marija still holding him, and the women staring\r\nat him in dumb, helpless fright.",
        "And then again Ona cried out; he could hear it nearly as plainly here,\r\nand he staggered to his feet.",
        "“How long has this been going on?” he\r\npanted.",
        "“Not very long,” Marija answered, and then, at a signal from Aniele,\r\nshe rushed on: “You go away, Jurgis you can’t help—go away and come\r\nback later.",
        "It’s all right—it’s—”\r\n\r\n“Who’s with her?” Jurgis demanded; and then, seeing Marija hesitating,\r\nhe cried again, “Who’s with her?”\r\n\r\n“She’s—she’s all right,” she answered.",
        "“Elzbieta’s with her.”\r\n\r\n“But the doctor!” he panted.",
        "“Some one who knows!”\r\n\r\nHe seized Marija by the arm; she trembled, and her voice sank beneath a\r\nwhisper as she replied, “We—we have no money.” Then, frightened at the\r\nlook on his face, she exclaimed: “It’s all right, Jurgis!",
        "You don’t\r\nunderstand—go away—go away!",
        "Ah, if you only had waited!”\r\n\r\nAbove her protests Jurgis heard Ona again; he was almost out of his\r\nmind.",
        "It was all new to him, raw and horrible—it had fallen upon him\r\nlike a lightning stroke.",
        "When little Antanas was born he had been at\r\nwork, and had known nothing about it until it was over; and now he was\r\nnot to be controlled.",
        "The frightened women were at their wits’ end; one\r\nafter another they tried to reason with him, to make him understand\r\nthat this was the lot of woman.",
        "In the end they half drove him out into\r\nthe rain, where he began to pace up and down, bareheaded and frantic.",
        "Because he could hear Ona from the street, he would first go away to\r\nescape the sounds, and then come back because he could not help it.",
        "At\r\nthe end of a quarter of an hour he rushed up the steps again, and for\r\nfear that he would break in the door they had to open it and let him\r\nin.",
        "There was no arguing with him.",
        "They could not tell him that all was\r\ngoing well—how could they know, he cried—why, she was dying, she was\r\nbeing torn to pieces!",
        "Listen to her—listen!",
        "Why, it was monstrous—it\r\ncould not be allowed—there must be some help for it!",
        "Had they tried to\r\nget a doctor?",
        "They might pay him afterward—they could promise—\r\n\r\n“We couldn’t promise, Jurgis,” protested Marija.",
        "“We had no money—we\r\nhave scarcely been able to keep alive.”\r\n\r\n“But I can work,” Jurgis exclaimed.",
        "“I can earn money!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered—“but we thought you were in jail.",
        "How could we know\r\nwhen you would return?",
        "They will not work for nothing.”\r\n\r\nMarija went on to tell how she had tried to find a midwife, and how\r\nthey had demanded ten, fifteen, even twenty-five dollars, and that in\r\ncash.",
        "“And I had only a quarter,” she said.",
        "“I have spent every cent of\r\nmy money—all that I had in the bank; and I owe the doctor who has been\r\ncoming to see me, and he has stopped because he thinks I don’t mean to\r\npay him.",
        "And we owe Aniele for two weeks’ rent, and she is nearly\r\nstarving, and is afraid of being turned out.",
        "We have been borrowing and\r\nbegging to keep alive, and there is nothing more we can do—”\r\n\r\n“And the children?” cried Jurgis.",
        "“The children have not been home for three days, the weather has been\r\nso bad.",
        "They could not know what is happening—it came suddenly, two\r\nmonths before we expected it.”\r\n\r\nJurgis was standing by the table, and he caught himself with his hand;\r\nhis head sank and his arms shook—it looked as if he were going to\r\ncollapse.",
        "Then suddenly Aniele got up and came hobbling toward him,\r\nfumbling in her skirt pocket.",
        "She drew out a dirty rag, in one corner\r\nof which she had something tied.",
        "“Here, Jurgis!” she said, “I have some money.",
        "_Palauk!_ See!”\r\n\r\nShe unwrapped it and counted it out—thirty-four cents.",
        "“You go, now,”\r\nshe said, “and try and get somebody yourself.",
        "And maybe the rest can\r\nhelp—give him some money, you; he will pay you back some day, and it\r\nwill do him good to have something to think about, even if he doesn’t\r\nsucceed.",
        "When he comes back, maybe it will be over.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the other women turned out the contents of their pocketbooks;\r\nmost of them had only pennies and nickels, but they gave him all.",
        "Mrs.",
        "Olszewski, who lived next door, and had a husband who was a skilled\r\ncattle butcher, but a drinking man, gave nearly half a dollar, enough\r\nto raise the whole sum to a dollar and a quarter.",
        "Then Jurgis thrust it\r\ninto his pocket, still holding it tightly in his fist, and started away\r\nat a run.",
        "CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n“Madame Haupt Hebamme”, ran a sign, swinging from a second-story window\r\nover a saloon on the avenue; at a side door was another sign, with a\r\nhand pointing up a dingy flight of stairs.",
        "Jurgis went up them, three\r\nat a time.",
        "Madame Haupt was frying pork and onions, and had her door half open to\r\nlet out the smoke.",
        "When he tried to knock upon it, it swung open the\r\nrest of the way, and he had a glimpse of her, with a black bottle\r\nturned up to her lips.",
        "Then he knocked louder, and she started and put\r\nit away.",
        "She was a Dutchwoman, enormously fat—when she walked she\r\nrolled like a small boat on the ocean, and the dishes in the cupboard\r\njostled each other.",
        "She wore a filthy blue wrapper, and her teeth were\r\nblack.",
        "“Vot is it?” she said, when she saw Jurgis.",
        "He had run like mad all the way and was so out of breath he could\r\nhardly speak.",
        "His hair was flying and his eyes wild—he looked like a\r\nman that had risen from the tomb.",
        "“My wife!” he panted.",
        "“Come quickly!”\r\nMadame Haupt set the frying pan to one side and wiped her hands on her\r\nwrapper.",
        "“You vant me to come for a case?” she inquired.",
        "“Yes,” gasped Jurgis.",
        "“I haf yust come back from a case,” she said.",
        "“I haf had no time to eat\r\nmy dinner.",
        "Still—if it is so bad—”\r\n\r\n“Yes—it is!” cried he.",
        "“Vell, den, perhaps—vot you pay?”\r\n\r\n“I—I—how much do you want?” Jurgis stammered.",
        "“Tventy-five dollars.” His face fell.",
        "“I can’t pay that,” he said.",
        "The woman was watching him narrowly.",
        "“How much do you pay?” she\r\ndemanded.",
        "“Must I pay now—right away?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; all my customers do.”\r\n\r\n“I—I haven’t much money,” Jurgis began in an agony of dread.",
        "“I’ve been\r\nin—in trouble—and my money is gone.",
        "But I’ll pay you—every cent—just as\r\nsoon as I can; I can work—”\r\n\r\n“Vot is your work?”\r\n\r\n“I have no place now.",
        "I must get one.",
        "But I—”\r\n\r\n“How much haf you got now?”\r\n\r\nHe could hardly bring himself to reply.",
        "When he said “A dollar and a\r\nquarter,” the woman laughed in his face.",
        "“I vould not put on my hat for a dollar and a quarter,” she said.",
        "“It’s all I’ve got,” he pleaded, his voice breaking.",
        "“I must get some\r\none—my wife will die.",
        "I can’t help it—I—”\r\n\r\nMadame Haupt had put back her pork and onions on the stove.",
        "She turned\r\nto him and answered, out of the steam and noise: “Git me ten dollars\r\ncash, und so you can pay me the rest next mont’.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t do it—I haven’t got it!” Jurgis protested.",
        "“I tell you I have\r\nonly a dollar and a quarter.”\r\n\r\nThe woman turned to her work.",
        "“I don’t believe you,” she said.",
        "“Dot is\r\nall to try to sheat me.",
        "Vot is de reason a big man like you has got\r\nonly a dollar und a quarter?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve just been in jail,” Jurgis cried—he was ready to get down upon\r\nhis knees to the woman—“and I had no money before, and my family has\r\nalmost starved.”\r\n\r\n“Vere is your friends, dot ought to help you?”\r\n\r\n“They are all poor,” he answered.",
        "“They gave me this.",
        "I have done\r\neverything I can—”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you got notting you can sell?”\r\n\r\n“I have nothing, I tell you—I have nothing,” he cried, frantically.",
        "“Can’t you borrow it, den?",
        "Don’t your store people trust you?” Then, as\r\nhe shook his head, she went on: “Listen to me—if you git me you vill be\r\nglad of it.",
        "I vill save your wife und baby for you, and it vill not\r\nseem like mooch to you in de end.",
        "If you loose dem now how you tink you\r\nfeel den?",
        "Und here is a lady dot knows her business—I could send you to\r\npeople in dis block, und dey vould tell you—”\r\n\r\nMadame Haupt was pointing her cooking-fork at Jurgis persuasively; but\r\nher words were more than he could bear.",
        "He flung up his hands with a\r\ngesture of despair and turned and started away.",
        "“It’s no use,” he\r\nexclaimed—but suddenly he heard the woman’s voice behind him again—\r\n\r\n“I vill make it five dollars for you.”\r\n\r\nShe followed behind him, arguing with him.",
        "“You vill be foolish not to\r\ntake such an offer,” she said.",
        "“You von’t find nobody go out on a rainy\r\nday like dis for less.",
        "Vy, I haf never took a case in my life so sheap\r\nas dot.",
        "I couldn’t pay mine room rent—”\r\n\r\nJurgis interrupted her with an oath of rage.",
        "“If I haven’t got it,” he\r\nshouted, “how can I pay it?",
        "Damn it, I would pay you if I could, but I\r\ntell you I haven’t got it.",
        "I haven’t got it!",
        "Do you hear me—_I haven’t\r\ngot it!_”\r\n\r\nHe turned and started away again.",
        "He was halfway down the stairs before\r\nMadame Haupt could shout to him: “Vait!",
        "I vill go mit you!",
        "Come back!”\r\n\r\nHe went back into the room again.",
        "“It is not goot to tink of anybody suffering,” she said, in a\r\nmelancholy voice.",
        "“I might as vell go mit you for noffing as vot you\r\noffer me, but I vill try to help you.",
        "How far is it?”\r\n\r\n“Three or four blocks from here.”\r\n\r\n“Tree or four!",
        "Und so I shall get soaked!",
        "Gott in Himmel, it ought to\r\nbe vorth more!",
        "Vun dollar und a quarter, und a day like dis!—But you\r\nunderstand now—you vill pay me de rest of twenty-five dollars soon?”\r\n\r\n“As soon as I can.”\r\n\r\n“Some time dis mont’?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, within a month,” said poor Jurgis.",
        "“Anything!",
        "Hurry up!”\r\n\r\n“Vere is de dollar und a quarter?” persisted Madame Haupt,\r\nrelentlessly.",
        "Jurgis put the money on the table and the woman counted it and stowed\r\nit away.",
        "Then she wiped her greasy hands again and proceeded to get\r\nready, complaining all the time; she was so fat that it was painful for\r\nher to move, and she grunted and gasped at every step.",
        "She took off her\r\nwrapper without even taking the trouble to turn her back to Jurgis, and\r\nput on her corsets and dress.",
        "Then there was a black bonnet which had\r\nto be adjusted carefully, and an umbrella which was mislaid, and a bag\r\nfull of necessaries which had to be collected from here and there—the\r\nman being nearly crazy with anxiety in the meantime.",
        "When they were on\r\nthe street he kept about four paces ahead of her, turning now and then,\r\nas if he could hurry her on by the force of his desire.",
        "But Madame\r\nHaupt could only go so far at a step, and it took all her attention to\r\nget the needed breath for that.",
        "They came at last to the house, and to the group of frightened women in\r\nthe kitchen.",
        "It was not over yet, Jurgis learned—he heard Ona crying\r\nstill; and meantime Madame Haupt removed her bonnet and laid it on the\r\nmantelpiece, and got out of her bag, first an old dress and then a\r\nsaucer of goose grease, which she proceeded to rub upon her hands.",
        "The\r\nmore cases this goose grease is used in, the better luck it brings to\r\nthe midwife, and so she keeps it upon her kitchen mantelpiece or stowed\r\naway in a cupboard with her dirty clothes, for months, and sometimes\r\neven for years.",
        "Then they escorted her to the ladder, and Jurgis heard her give an\r\nexclamation of dismay.",
        "“Gott in Himmel, vot for haf you brought me to a\r\nplace like dis?",
        "I could not climb up dot ladder.",
        "I could not git troo a\r\ntrap door!",
        "I vill not try it—vy, I might kill myself already.",
        "Vot sort\r\nof a place is dot for a woman to bear a child in—up in a garret, mit\r\nonly a ladder to it?",
        "You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!” Jurgis\r\nstood in the doorway and listened to her scolding, half drowning out\r\nthe horrible moans and screams of Ona.",
        "At last Aniele succeeded in pacifying her, and she essayed the ascent;\r\nthen, however, she had to be stopped while the old woman cautioned her\r\nabout the floor of the garret.",
        "They had no real floor—they had laid old\r\nboards in one part to make a place for the family to live; it was all\r\nright and safe there, but the other part of the garret had only the\r\njoists of the floor, and the lath and plaster of the ceiling below, and\r\nif one stepped on this there would be a catastrophe.",
        "As it was half\r\ndark up above, perhaps one of the others had best go up first with a\r\ncandle.",
        "Then there were more outcries and threatening, until at last\r\nJurgis had a vision of a pair of elephantine legs disappearing through\r\nthe trap door, and felt the house shake as Madame Haupt started to\r\nwalk.",
        "Then suddenly Aniele came to him and took him by the arm.",
        "“Now,” she said, “you go away.",
        "Do as I tell you—you have done all you\r\ncan, and you are only in the way.",
        "Go away and stay away.”\r\n\r\n“But where shall I go?” Jurgis asked, helplessly.",
        "“I don’t know where,” she answered.",
        "“Go on the street, if there is no\r\nother place—only go!",
        "And stay all night!”\r\n\r\nIn the end she and Marija pushed him out of the door and shut it behind\r\nhim.",
        "It was just about sundown, and it was turning cold—the rain had\r\nchanged to snow, and the slush was freezing.",
        "Jurgis shivered in his\r\nthin clothing, and put his hands into his pockets and started away.",
        "He\r\nhad not eaten since morning, and he felt weak and ill; with a sudden\r\nthrob of hope he recollected he was only a few blocks from the saloon\r\nwhere he had been wont to eat his dinner.",
        "They might have mercy on him\r\nthere, or he might meet a friend.",
        "He set out for the place as fast as\r\nhe could walk.",
        "“Hello, Jack,” said the saloon-keeper, when he entered—they call all\r\nforeigners and unskilled men “Jack” in Packingtown.",
        "“Where’ve you\r\nbeen?”\r\n\r\nJurgis went straight to the bar.",
        "“I’ve been in jail,” he said, “and\r\nI’ve just got out.",
        "I walked home all the way, and I’ve not a cent, and\r\nhad nothing to eat since this morning.",
        "And I’ve lost my home, and my\r\nwife’s ill, and I’m done up.”\r\n\r\nThe saloon-keeper gazed at him, with his haggard white face and his\r\nblue trembling lips.",
        "Then he pushed a big bottle toward him.",
        "“Fill her\r\nup!” he said.",
        "Jurgis could hardly hold the bottle, his hands shook so.",
        "“Don’t be afraid,” said the saloon-keeper, “fill her up!”\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis drank a large glass of whisky, and then turned to the lunch\r\ncounter, in obedience to the other’s suggestion.",
        "He ate all he dared,\r\nstuffing it in as fast as he could; and then, after trying to speak his\r\ngratitude, he went and sat down by the big red stove in the middle of\r\nthe room.",
        "It was too good to last, however—like all things in this hard world.",
        "His soaked clothing began to steam, and the horrible stench of\r\nfertilizer to fill the room.",
        "In an hour or so the packing houses would\r\nbe closing and the men coming in from their work; and they would not\r\ncome into a place that smelt of Jurgis.",
        "Also it was Saturday night, and\r\nin a couple of hours would come a violin and a cornet, and in the rear\r\npart of the saloon the families of the neighborhood would dance and\r\nfeast upon wienerwurst and lager, until two or three o’clock in the\r\nmorning.",
        "The saloon-keeper coughed once or twice, and then remarked,\r\n“Say, Jack, I’m afraid you’ll have to quit.”\r\n\r\nHe was used to the sight of human wrecks, this saloon-keeper; he\r\n“fired” dozens of them every night, just as haggard and cold and\r\nforlorn as this one.",
        "But they were all men who had given up and been\r\ncounted out, while Jurgis was still in the fight, and had reminders of\r\ndecency about him.",
        "As he got up meekly, the other reflected that he had\r\nalways been a steady man, and might soon be a good customer again.",
        "“You’ve been up against it, I see,” he said.",
        "“Come this way.”\r\n\r\nIn the rear of the saloon were the cellar stairs.",
        "There was a door\r\nabove and another below, both safely padlocked, making the stairs an\r\nadmirable place to stow away a customer who might still chance to have\r\nmoney, or a political light whom it was not advisable to kick out of\r\ndoors.",
        "So Jurgis spent the night.",
        "The whisky had only half warmed him, and he\r\ncould not sleep, exhausted as he was; he would nod forward, and then\r\nstart up, shivering with the cold, and begin to remember again.",
        "Hour\r\nafter hour passed, until he could only persuade himself that it was not\r\nmorning by the sounds of music and laughter and singing that were to be\r\nheard from the room.",
        "When at last these ceased, he expected that he\r\nwould be turned out into the street; as this did not happen, he fell to\r\nwondering whether the man had forgotten him.",
        "In the end, when the silence and suspense were no longer to be borne,\r\nhe got up and hammered on the door; and the proprietor came, yawning\r\nand rubbing his eyes.",
        "He was keeping open all night, and dozing between\r\ncustomers.",
        "“I want to go home,” Jurgis said.",
        "“I’m worried about my wife—I can’t\r\nwait any longer.”\r\n\r\n“Why the hell didn’t you say so before?” said the man.",
        "“I thought you\r\ndidn’t have any home to go to.” Jurgis went outside.",
        "It was four\r\no’clock in the morning, and as black as night.",
        "There were three or four\r\ninches of fresh snow on the ground, and the flakes were falling thick\r\nand fast.",
        "He turned toward Aniele’s and started at a run.",
        "There was a light burning in the kitchen window and the blinds were\r\ndrawn.",
        "The door was unlocked and Jurgis rushed in.",
        "Aniele, Marija, and the rest of the women were huddled about the stove,\r\nexactly as before; with them were several newcomers, Jurgis\r\nnoticed—also he noticed that the house was silent.",
        "“Well?” he said.",
        "No one answered him, they sat staring at him with their pale faces.",
        "He\r\ncried again: “Well?”\r\n\r\nAnd then, by the light of the smoky lamp, he saw Marija who sat nearest\r\nhim, shaking her head slowly.",
        "“Not yet,” she said.",
        "And Jurgis gave a cry of dismay.",
        "“Not _yet?_”\r\n\r\nAgain Marija’s head shook.",
        "The poor fellow stood dumfounded.",
        "“I don’t\r\nhear her,” he gasped.",
        "“She’s been quiet a long time,” replied the other.",
        "There was another pause—broken suddenly by a voice from the attic:\r\n“Hello, there!”\r\n\r\nSeveral of the women ran into the next room, while Marija sprang toward\r\nJurgis.",
        "“Wait here!” she cried, and the two stood, pale and trembling,\r\nlistening.",
        "In a few moments it became clear that Madame Haupt was\r\nengaged in descending the ladder, scolding and exhorting again, while\r\nthe ladder creaked in protest.",
        "In a moment or two she reached the\r\nground, angry and breathless, and they heard her coming into the room.",
        "Jurgis gave one glance at her, and then turned white and reeled.",
        "She\r\nhad her jacket off, like one of the workers on the killing beds.",
        "Her\r\nhands and arms were smeared with blood, and blood was splashed upon her\r\nclothing and her face.",
        "She stood breathing hard, and gazing about her; no one made a sound.",
        "“I\r\nhaf done my best,” she began suddenly.",
        "“I can do noffing more—dere is\r\nno use to try.”\r\n\r\nAgain there was silence.",
        "“It ain’t my fault,” she said.",
        "“You had ought to haf had a doctor, und\r\nnot vaited so long—it vas too late already ven I come.” Once more there\r\nwas deathlike stillness.",
        "Marija was clutching Jurgis with all the power\r\nof her one well arm.",
        "Then suddenly Madame Haupt turned to Aniele.",
        "“You haf not got something\r\nto drink, hey?” she queried.",
        "“Some brandy?”\r\n\r\nAniele shook her head.",
        "“Herr Gott!” exclaimed Madame Haupt.",
        "“Such people!",
        "Perhaps you vill\r\ngive me someting to eat den—I haf had noffing since yesterday morning,\r\nund I haf vorked myself near to death here.",
        "If I could haf known it vas\r\nlike dis, I vould never haf come for such money as you gif me.” At this\r\nmoment she chanced to look round, and saw Jurgis: She shook her finger\r\nat him.",
        "“You understand me,” she said, “you pays me dot money yust de\r\nsame!",
        "It is not my fault dat you send for me so late I can’t help your\r\nvife.",
        "It is not my fault if der baby comes mit one arm first, so dot I\r\ncan’t save it.",
        "I haf tried all night, und in dot place vere it is not\r\nfit for dogs to be born, und mit notting to eat only vot I brings in\r\nmine own pockets.”\r\n\r\nHere Madame Haupt paused for a moment to get her breath; and Marija,\r\nseeing the beads of sweat on Jurgis’s forehead, and feeling the\r\nquivering of his frame, broke out in a low voice: “How is Ona?”\r\n\r\n“How is she?” echoed Madame Haupt.",
        "“How do you tink she can be ven you\r\nleave her to kill herself so?",
        "I told dem dot ven they send for de\r\npriest.",
        "She is young, und she might haf got over it, und been vell und\r\nstrong, if she had been treated right.",
        "She fight hard, dot girl—she is\r\nnot yet quite dead.”\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis gave a frantic scream.",
        "“_Dead!_”\r\n\r\n“She vill die, of course,” said the other angrily.",
        "“Der baby is dead\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nThe garret was lighted by a candle stuck upon a board; it had almost\r\nburned itself out, and was sputtering and smoking as Jurgis rushed up\r\nthe ladder.",
        "He could make out dimly in one corner a pallet of rags and\r\nold blankets, spread upon the floor; at the foot of it was a crucifix,\r\nand near it a priest muttering a prayer.",
        "In a far corner crouched\r\nElzbieta, moaning and wailing.",
        "Upon the pallet lay Ona.",
        "She was covered with a blanket, but he could see her shoulders and one\r\narm lying bare; she was so shrunken he would scarcely have known\r\nher—she was all but a skeleton, and as white as a piece of chalk.",
        "Her\r\neyelids were closed, and she lay still as death.",
        "He staggered toward\r\nher and fell upon his knees with a cry of anguish: “Ona!",
        "Ona!”\r\n\r\nShe did not stir.",
        "He caught her hand in his, and began to clasp it\r\nfrantically, calling: “Look at me!",
        "Answer me!",
        "It is Jurgis come\r\nback—don’t you hear me?”\r\n\r\nThere was the faintest quivering of the eyelids, and he called again in\r\nfrenzy: “Ona!",
        "Ona!”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly her eyes opened one instant.",
        "One instant she looked at\r\nhim—there was a flash of recognition between them, he saw her afar off,\r\nas through a dim vista, standing forlorn.",
        "He stretched out his arms to\r\nher, he called her in wild despair; a fearful yearning surged up in\r\nhim, hunger for her that was agony, desire that was a new being born\r\nwithin him, tearing his heartstrings, torturing him.",
        "But it was all in\r\nvain—she faded from him, she slipped back and was gone.",
        "And a wail of\r\nanguish burst from him, great sobs shook all his frame, and hot tears\r\nran down his cheeks and fell upon her.",
        "He clutched her hands, he shook\r\nher, he caught her in his arms and pressed her to him but she lay cold\r\nand still—she was gone—she was gone!",
        "The word rang through him like the sound of a bell, echoing in the far\r\ndepths of him, making forgotten chords to vibrate, old shadowy fears to\r\nstir—fears of the dark, fears of the void, fears of annihilation.",
        "She\r\nwas dead!",
        "She was dead!",
        "He would never see her again, never hear her\r\nagain!",
        "An icy horror of loneliness seized him; he saw himself standing\r\napart and watching all the world fade away from him—a world of shadows,\r\nof fickle dreams.",
        "He was like a little child, in his fright and grief;\r\nhe called and called, and got no answer, and his cries of despair\r\nechoed through the house, making the women downstairs draw nearer to\r\neach other in fear.",
        "He was inconsolable, beside himself—the priest came\r\nand laid his hand upon his shoulder and whispered to him, but he heard\r\nnot a sound.",
        "He was gone away himself, stumbling through the shadows,\r\nand groping after the soul that had fled.",
        "So he lay.",
        "The gray dawn came up and crept into the attic.",
        "The priest\r\nleft, the women left, and he was alone with the still, white\r\nfigure—quieter now, but moaning and shuddering, wrestling with the\r\ngrisly fiend.",
        "Now and then he would raise himself and stare at the\r\nwhite mask before him, then hide his eyes because he could not bear it.",
        "Dead!",
        "_dead!_ And she was only a girl, she was barely eighteen!",
        "Her\r\nlife had hardly begun—and here she lay murdered—mangled, tortured to\r\ndeath!",
        "It was morning when he rose up and came down into the kitchen—haggard\r\nand ashen gray, reeling and dazed.",
        "More of the neighbors had come in,\r\nand they stared at him in silence as he sank down upon a chair by the\r\ntable and buried his face in his arms.",
        "A few minutes later the front door opened; a blast of cold and snow\r\nrushed in, and behind it little Kotrina, breathless from running, and\r\nblue with the cold.",
        "“I’m home again!” she exclaimed.",
        "“I could hardly—”\r\n\r\nAnd then, seeing Jurgis, she stopped with an exclamation.",
        "Looking from\r\none to another she saw that something had happened, and she asked, in a\r\nlower voice: “What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nBefore anyone could reply, Jurgis started up; he went toward her,\r\nwalking unsteadily.",
        "“Where have you been?” he demanded.",
        "“Selling papers with the boys,” she said.",
        "“The snow—”\r\n\r\n“Have you any money?” he demanded.",
        "“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“How much?”\r\n\r\n“Nearly three dollars, Jurgis.”\r\n\r\n“Give it to me.”\r\n\r\nKotrina, frightened by his manner, glanced at the others.",
        "“Give it to\r\nme!” he commanded again, and she put her hand into her pocket and\r\npulled out a lump of coins tied in a bit of rag.",
        "Jurgis took it without\r\na word, and went out of the door and down the street.",
        "Three doors away was a saloon.",
        "“Whisky,” he said, as he entered, and as\r\nthe man pushed him some, he tore at the rag with his teeth and pulled\r\nout half a dollar.",
        "“How much is the bottle?” he said.",
        "“I want to get\r\ndrunk.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a big man cannot stay drunk very long on three dollars.",
        "That was\r\nSunday morning, and Monday night Jurgis came home, sober and sick,\r\nrealizing that he had spent every cent the family owned, and had not\r\nbought a single instant’s forgetfulness with it.",
        "Ona was not yet buried; but the police had been notified, and on the\r\nmorrow they would put the body in a pine coffin and take it to the\r\npotter’s field.",
        "Elzbieta was out begging now, a few pennies from each\r\nof the neighbors, to get enough to pay for a mass for her; and the\r\nchildren were upstairs starving to death, while he, good-for-nothing\r\nrascal, had been spending their money on drink.",
        "So spoke Aniele,\r\nscornfully, and when he started toward the fire she added the\r\ninformation that her kitchen was no longer for him to fill with his\r\nphosphate stinks.",
        "She had crowded all her boarders into one room on\r\nOna’s account, but now he could go up in the garret where he\r\nbelonged—and not there much longer, either, if he did not pay her some\r\nrent.",
        "Jurgis went without a word, and, stepping over half a dozen sleeping\r\nboarders in the next room, ascended the ladder.",
        "It was dark up above;\r\nthey could not afford any light; also it was nearly as cold as\r\noutdoors.",
        "In a corner, as far away from the corpse as possible, sat\r\nMarija, holding little Antanas in her one good arm and trying to soothe\r\nhim to sleep.",
        "In another corner crouched poor little Juozapas, wailing\r\nbecause he had had nothing to eat all day.",
        "Marija said not a word to\r\nJurgis; he crept in like a whipped cur, and went and sat down by the\r\nbody.",
        "Perhaps he ought to have meditated upon the hunger of the children, and\r\nupon his own baseness; but he thought only of Ona, he gave himself up\r\nagain to the luxury of grief.",
        "He shed no tears, being ashamed to make a\r\nsound; he sat motionless and shuddering with his anguish.",
        "He had never\r\ndreamed how much he loved Ona, until now that she was gone; until now\r\nthat he sat here, knowing that on the morrow they would take her away,\r\nand that he would never lay eyes upon her again—never all the days of\r\nhis life.",
        "His old love, which had been starved to death, beaten to\r\ndeath, awoke in him again; the floodgates of memory were lifted—he saw\r\nall their life together, saw her as he had seen her in Lithuania, the\r\nfirst day at the fair, beautiful as the flowers, singing like a bird.",
        "He saw her as he had married her, with all her tenderness, with her\r\nheart of wonder; the very words she had spoken seemed to ring now in\r\nhis ears, the tears she had shed to be wet upon his cheek.",
        "The long,\r\ncruel battle with misery and hunger had hardened and embittered him,\r\nbut it had not changed her—she had been the same hungry soul to the\r\nend, stretching out her arms to him, pleading with him, begging him for\r\nlove and tenderness.",
        "And she had suffered—so cruelly she had suffered,\r\nsuch agonies, such infamies—ah, God, the memory of them was not to be\r\nborne.",
        "What a monster of wickedness, of heartlessness, he had been!",
        "Every angry word that he had ever spoken came back to him and cut him\r\nlike a knife; every selfish act that he had done—with what torments he\r\npaid for them now!",
        "And such devotion and awe as welled up in his\r\nsoul—now that it could never be spoken, now that it was too late, too\r\nlate!",
        "His bosom-was choking with it, bursting with it; he crouched here\r\nin the darkness beside her, stretching out his arms to her—and she was\r\ngone forever, she was dead!",
        "He could have screamed aloud with the\r\nhorror and despair of it; a sweat of agony beaded his forehead, yet he\r\ndared not make a sound—he scarcely dared to breathe, because of his\r\nshame and loathing of himself.",
        "Late at night came Elzbieta, having gotten the money for a mass, and\r\npaid for it in advance, lest she should be tempted too sorely at home.",
        "She brought also a bit of stale rye bread that some one had given her,\r\nand with that they quieted the children and got them to sleep.",
        "Then she\r\ncame over to Jurgis and sat down beside him.",
        "She said not a word of reproach—she and Marija had chosen that course\r\nbefore; she would only plead with him, here by the corpse of his dead\r\nwife.",
        "Already Elzbieta had choked down her tears, grief being crowded\r\nout of her soul by fear.",
        "She had to bury one of her children—but then\r\nshe had done it three times before, and each time risen up and gone\r\nback to take up the battle for the rest.",
        "Elzbieta was one of the\r\nprimitive creatures: like the angleworm, which goes on living though\r\ncut in half; like a hen, which, deprived of her chickens one by one,\r\nwill mother the last that is left her.",
        "She did this because it was her\r\nnature—she asked no questions about the justice of it, nor the\r\nworth-whileness of life in which destruction and death ran riot.",
        "And this old common-sense view she labored to impress upon Jurgis,\r\npleading with him with tears in her eyes.",
        "Ona was dead, but the others\r\nwere left and they must be saved.",
        "She did not ask for her own children.",
        "She and Marija could care for them somehow, but there was Antanas, his\r\nown son.",
        "Ona had given Antanas to him—the little fellow was the only\r\nremembrance of her that he had; he must treasure it and protect it, he\r\nmust show himself a man.",
        "He knew what Ona would have had him do, what\r\nshe would ask of him at this moment, if she could speak to him.",
        "It was\r\na terrible thing that she should have died as she had; but the life had\r\nbeen too hard for her, and she had to go.",
        "It was terrible that they\r\nwere not able to bury her, that he could not even have a day to mourn\r\nher—but so it was.",
        "Their fate was pressing; they had not a cent, and\r\nthe children would perish—some money must be had.",
        "Could he not be a man\r\nfor Ona’s sake, and pull himself together?",
        "In a little while they would\r\nbe out of danger—now that they had given up the house they could live\r\nmore cheaply, and with all the children working they could get along,\r\nif only he would not go to pieces.",
        "So Elzbieta went on, with feverish\r\nintensity.",
        "It was a struggle for life with her; she was not afraid that\r\nJurgis would go on drinking, for he had no money for that, but she was\r\nwild with dread at the thought that he might desert them, might take to\r\nthe road, as Jonas had done.",
        "But with Ona’s dead body beneath his eyes, Jurgis could not well think\r\nof treason to his child.",
        "Yes, he said, he would try, for the sake of\r\nAntanas.",
        "He would give the little fellow his chance—would get to work\r\nat once, yes, tomorrow, without even waiting for Ona to be buried.",
        "They\r\nmight trust him, he would keep his word, come what might.",
        "And so he was out before daylight the next morning, headache,\r\nheartache, and all.",
        "He went straight to Graham’s fertilizer mill, to\r\nsee if he could get back his job.",
        "But the boss shook his head when he\r\nsaw him—no, his place had been filled long ago, and there was no room\r\nfor him.",
        "“Do you think there will be?” Jurgis asked.",
        "“I may have to wait.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the other, “it will not be worth your while to wait—there\r\nwill be nothing for you here.”\r\n\r\nJurgis stood gazing at him in perplexity.",
        "“What is the matter?” he\r\nasked.",
        "“Didn’t I do my work?”\r\n\r\nThe other met his look with one of cold indifference, and answered,\r\n“There will be nothing for you here, I said.”\r\n\r\nJurgis had his suspicions as to the dreadful meaning of that incident,\r\nand he went away with a sinking at the heart.",
        "He went and took his\r\nstand with the mob of hungry wretches who were standing about in the\r\nsnow before the time station.",
        "Here he stayed, breakfastless, for two\r\nhours, until the throng was driven away by the clubs of the police.",
        "There was no work for him that day.",
        "Jurgis had made a good many acquaintances in his long services at the\r\nyards—there were saloonkeepers who would trust him for a drink and a\r\nsandwich, and members of his old union who would lend him a dime at a\r\npinch.",
        "It was not a question of life and death for him, therefore; he\r\nmight hunt all day, and come again on the morrow, and try hanging on\r\nthus for weeks, like hundreds and thousands of others.",
        "Meantime, Teta\r\nElzbieta would go and beg, over in the Hyde Park district, and the\r\nchildren would bring home enough to pacify Aniele, and keep them all\r\nalive.",
        "It was at the end of a week of this sort of waiting, roaming about in\r\nthe bitter winds or loafing in saloons, that Jurgis stumbled on a\r\nchance in one of the cellars of Jones’s big packing plant.",
        "He saw a\r\nforeman passing the open doorway, and hailed him for a job.",
        "“Push a truck?” inquired the man, and Jurgis answered, “Yes, sir!”\r\nbefore the words were well out of his mouth.",
        "“What’s your name?” demanded the other.",
        "“Jurgis Rudkus.”\r\n\r\n“Worked in the yards before?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Whereabouts?”\r\n\r\n“Two places—Brown’s killing beds and Durham’s fertilizer mill.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you leave there?”\r\n\r\n“The first time I had an accident, and the last time I was sent up for\r\na month.”\r\n\r\n“I see.",
        "Well, I’ll give you a trial.",
        "Come early tomorrow and ask for\r\nMr.",
        "Thomas.”\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis rushed home with the wild tidings that he had a job—that the\r\nterrible siege was over.",
        "The remnants of the family had quite a\r\ncelebration that night; and in the morning Jurgis was at the place half\r\nan hour before the time of opening.",
        "The foreman came in shortly\r\nafterward, and when he saw Jurgis he frowned.",
        "“Oh,” he said, “I promised you a job, didn’t I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said Jurgis.",
        "“Well, I’m sorry, but I made a mistake.",
        "I can’t use you.”\r\n\r\nJurgis stared, dumfounded.",
        "“What’s the matter?” he gasped.",
        "“Nothing,” said the man, “only I can’t use you.”\r\n\r\nThere was the same cold, hostile stare that he had had from the boss of\r\nthe fertilizer mill.",
        "He knew that there was no use in saying a word,\r\nand he turned and went away.",
        "Out in the saloons the men could tell him all about the meaning of it;\r\nthey gazed at him with pitying eyes—poor devil, he was blacklisted!",
        "What had he done?",
        "they asked—knocked down his boss?",
        "Good heavens, then\r\nhe might have known!",
        "Why, he stood as much chance of getting a job in\r\nPackingtown as of being chosen mayor of Chicago.",
        "Why had he wasted his\r\ntime hunting?",
        "They had him on a secret list in every office, big and\r\nlittle, in the place.",
        "They had his name by this time in St.",
        "Louis and\r\nNew York, in Omaha and Boston, in Kansas City and St.",
        "Joseph.",
        "He was\r\ncondemned and sentenced, without trial and without appeal; he could\r\nnever work for the packers again—he could not even clean cattle pens or\r\ndrive a truck in any place where they controlled.",
        "He might try it, if\r\nhe chose, as hundreds had tried it, and found out for themselves.",
        "He\r\nwould never be told anything about it; he would never get any more\r\nsatisfaction than he had gotten just now; but he would always find when\r\nthe time came that he was not needed.",
        "It would not do for him to give\r\nany other name, either—they had company “spotters” for just that\r\npurpose, and he wouldn’t keep a job in Packingtown three days.",
        "It was\r\nworth a fortune to the packers to keep their blacklist effective, as a\r\nwarning to the men and a means of keeping down union agitation and\r\npolitical discontent.",
        "Jurgis went home, carrying these new tidings to the family council.",
        "It\r\nwas a most cruel thing; here in this district was his home, such as it\r\nwas, the place he was used to and the friends he knew—and now every\r\npossibility of employment in it was closed to him.",
        "There was nothing in\r\nPackingtown but packing houses; and so it was the same thing as\r\nevicting him from his home.",
        "He and the two women spent all day and half the night discussing it.",
        "It\r\nwould be convenient, downtown, to the children’s place of work; but\r\nthen Marija was on the road to recovery, and had hopes of getting a job\r\nin the yards; and though she did not see her old-time lover once a\r\nmonth, because of the misery of their state, yet she could not make up\r\nher mind to go away and give him up forever.",
        "Then, too, Elzbieta had\r\nheard something about a chance to scrub floors in Durham’s offices and\r\nwas waiting every day for word.",
        "In the end it was decided that Jurgis\r\nshould go downtown to strike out for himself, and they would decide\r\nafter he got a job.",
        "As there was no one from whom he could borrow\r\nthere, and he dared not beg for fear of being arrested, it was arranged\r\nthat every day he should meet one of the children and be given fifteen\r\ncents of their earnings, upon which he could keep going.",
        "Then all day\r\nhe was to pace the streets with hundreds and thousands of other\r\nhomeless wretches inquiring at stores, warehouses, and factories for a\r\nchance; and at night he was to crawl into some doorway or underneath a\r\ntruck, and hide there until midnight, when he might get into one of the\r\nstation houses, and spread a newspaper upon the floor, and lie down in\r\nthe midst of a throng of “bums” and beggars, reeking with alcohol and\r\ntobacco, and filthy with vermin and disease.",
        "So for two weeks more Jurgis fought with the demon of despair.",
        "Once he\r\ngot a chance to load a truck for half a day, and again he carried an\r\nold woman’s valise and was given a quarter.",
        "This let him into a\r\nlodging-house on several nights when he might otherwise have frozen to\r\ndeath; and it also gave him a chance now and then to buy a newspaper in\r\nthe morning and hunt up jobs while his rivals were watching and waiting\r\nfor a paper to be thrown away.",
        "This, however, was really not the\r\nadvantage it seemed, for the newspaper advertisements were a cause of\r\nmuch loss of precious time and of many weary journeys.",
        "A full half of\r\nthese were “fakes,” put in by the endless variety of establishments\r\nwhich preyed upon the helpless ignorance of the unemployed.",
        "If Jurgis\r\nlost only his time, it was because he had nothing else to lose;\r\nwhenever a smooth-tongued agent would tell him of the wonderful\r\npositions he had on hand, he could only shake his head sorrowfully and\r\nsay that he had not the necessary dollar to deposit; when it was\r\nexplained to him what “big money” he and all his family could make by\r\ncoloring photographs, he could only promise to come in again when he\r\nhad two dollars to invest in the outfit.",
        "In the end Jurgis got a chance through an accidental meeting with an\r\nold-time acquaintance of his union days.",
        "He met this man on his way to\r\nwork in the giant factories of the Harvester Trust; and his friend told\r\nhim to come along and he would speak a good word for him to his boss,\r\nwhom he knew well.",
        "So Jurgis trudged four or five miles, and passed\r\nthrough a waiting throng of unemployed at the gate under the escort of\r\nhis friend.",
        "His knees nearly gave way beneath him when the foreman,\r\nafter looking him over and questioning him, told him that he could find\r\nan opening for him.",
        "How much this accident meant to Jurgis he realized only by stages; for\r\nhe found that the harvester works were the sort of place to which\r\nphilanthropists and reformers pointed with pride.",
        "It had some thought\r\nfor its employees; its workshops were big and roomy, it provided a\r\nrestaurant where the workmen could buy good food at cost, it had even a\r\nreading room, and decent places where its girl-hands could rest; also\r\nthe work was free from many of the elements of filth and repulsiveness\r\nthat prevailed at the stockyards.",
        "Day after day Jurgis discovered these\r\nthings—things never expected nor dreamed of by him—until this new place\r\ncame to seem a kind of a heaven to him.",
        "It was an enormous establishment, covering a hundred and sixty acres of\r\nground, employing five thousand people, and turning out over three\r\nhundred thousand machines every year—a good part of all the harvesting\r\nand mowing machines used in the country.",
        "Jurgis saw very little of it,\r\nof course—it was all specialized work, the same as at the stockyards;\r\neach one of the hundreds of parts of a mowing machine was made\r\nseparately, and sometimes handled by hundreds of men.",
        "Where Jurgis\r\nworked there was a machine which cut and stamped a certain piece of\r\nsteel about two square inches in size; the pieces came tumbling out\r\nupon a tray, and all that human hands had to do was to pile them in\r\nregular rows, and change the trays at intervals.",
        "This was done by a\r\nsingle boy, who stood with eyes and thought centered upon it, and\r\nfingers flying so fast that the sounds of the bits of steel striking\r\nupon each other was like the music of an express train as one hears it\r\nin a sleeping car at night.",
        "This was “piece-work,” of course; and\r\nbesides it was made certain that the boy did not idle, by setting the\r\nmachine to match the highest possible speed of human hands.",
        "Thirty\r\nthousand of these pieces he handled every day, nine or ten million\r\nevery year—how many in a lifetime it rested with the gods to say.",
        "Near\r\nby him men sat bending over whirling grindstones, putting the finishing\r\ntouches to the steel knives of the reaper; picking them out of a basket\r\nwith the right hand, pressing first one side and then the other against\r\nthe stone and finally dropping them with the left hand into another\r\nbasket.",
        "One of these men told Jurgis that he had sharpened three\r\nthousand pieces of steel a day for thirteen years.",
        "In the next room\r\nwere wonderful machines that ate up long steel rods by slow stages,\r\ncutting them off, seizing the pieces, stamping heads upon them,\r\ngrinding them and polishing them, threading them, and finally dropping\r\nthem into a basket, all ready to bolt the harvesters together.",
        "From yet\r\nanother machine came tens of thousands of steel burs to fit upon these\r\nbolts.",
        "In other places all these various parts were dipped into troughs\r\nof paint and hung up to dry, and then slid along on trolleys to a room\r\nwhere men streaked them with red and yellow, so that they might look\r\ncheerful in the harvest fields.",
        "Jurgis’s friend worked upstairs in the casting rooms, and his task was\r\nto make the molds of a certain part.",
        "He shoveled black sand into an\r\niron receptacle and pounded it tight and set it aside to harden; then\r\nit would be taken out, and molten iron poured into it.",
        "This man, too,\r\nwas paid by the mold—or rather for perfect castings, nearly half his\r\nwork going for naught.",
        "You might see him, along with dozens of others,\r\ntoiling like one possessed by a whole community of demons; his arms\r\nworking like the driving rods of an engine, his long, black hair flying\r\nwild, his eyes starting out, the sweat rolling in rivers down his face.",
        "When he had shoveled the mold full of sand, and reached for the pounder\r\nto pound it with, it was after the manner of a canoeist running rapids\r\nand seizing a pole at sight of a submerged rock.",
        "All day long this man\r\nwould toil thus, his whole being centered upon the purpose of making\r\ntwenty-three instead of twenty-two and a half cents an hour; and then\r\nhis product would be reckoned up by the census taker, and jubilant\r\ncaptains of industry would boast of it in their banquet halls, telling\r\nhow our workers are nearly twice as efficient as those of any other\r\ncountry.",
        "If we are the greatest nation the sun ever shone upon, it\r\nwould seem to be mainly because we have been able to goad our\r\nwage-earners to this pitch of frenzy; though there are a few other\r\nthings that are great among us including our drink-bill, which is a\r\nbillion and a quarter of dollars a year, and doubling itself every\r\ndecade.",
        "There was a machine which stamped out the iron plates, and then another\r\nwhich, with a mighty thud, mashed them to the shape of the sitting-down\r\nportion of the American farmer.",
        "Then they were piled upon a truck, and\r\nit was Jurgis’s task to wheel them to the room where the machines were\r\n“assembled.” This was child’s play for him, and he got a dollar and\r\nseventy-five cents a day for it; on Saturday he paid Aniele the\r\nseventy-five cents a week he owed her for the use of her garret, and\r\nalso redeemed his overcoat, which Elzbieta had put in pawn when he was\r\nin jail.",
        "This last was a great blessing.",
        "A man cannot go about in midwinter in\r\nChicago with no overcoat and not pay for it, and Jurgis had to walk or\r\nride five or six miles back and forth to his work.",
        "It so happened that\r\nhalf of this was in one direction and half in another, necessitating a\r\nchange of cars; the law required that transfers be given at all\r\nintersecting points, but the railway corporation had gotten round this\r\nby arranging a pretense at separate ownership.",
        "So whenever he wished to\r\nride, he had to pay ten cents each way, or over ten per cent of his\r\nincome to this power, which had gotten its franchises long ago by\r\nbuying up the city council, in the face of popular clamor amounting\r\nalmost to a rebellion.",
        "Tired as he felt at night, and dark and bitter\r\ncold as it was in the morning, Jurgis generally chose to walk; at the\r\nhours other workmen were traveling, the streetcar monopoly saw fit to\r\nput on so few cars that there would be men hanging to every foot of the\r\nbacks of them and often crouching upon the snow-covered roof.",
        "Of course\r\nthe doors could never be closed, and so the cars were as cold as\r\noutdoors; Jurgis, like many others, found it better to spend his fare\r\nfor a drink and a free lunch, to give him strength to walk.",
        "These, however, were all slight matters to a man who had escaped from\r\nDurham’s fertilizer mill.",
        "Jurgis began to pick up heart again and to\r\nmake plans.",
        "He had lost his house but then the awful load of the rent\r\nand interest was off his shoulders, and when Marija was well again they\r\ncould start over and save.",
        "In the shop where he worked was a man, a\r\nLithuanian like himself, whom the others spoke of in admiring whispers,\r\nbecause of the mighty feats he was performing.",
        "All day he sat at a\r\nmachine turning bolts; and then in the evening he went to the public\r\nschool to study English and learn to read.",
        "In addition, because he had\r\na family of eight children to support and his earnings were not enough,\r\non Saturdays and Sundays he served as a watchman; he was required to\r\npress two buttons at opposite ends of a building every five minutes,\r\nand as the walk only took him two minutes, he had three minutes to\r\nstudy between each trip.",
        "Jurgis felt jealous of this fellow; for that\r\nwas the sort of thing he himself had dreamed of, two or three years\r\nago.",
        "He might do it even yet, if he had a fair chance—he might attract\r\nattention and become a skilled man or a boss, as some had done in this\r\nplace.",
        "Suppose that Marija could get a job in the big mill where they\r\nmade binder twine—then they would move into this neighborhood, and he\r\nwould really have a chance.",
        "With a hope like that, there was some use\r\nin living; to find a place where you were treated like a human being—by\r\nGod!",
        "he would show them how he could appreciate it.",
        "He laughed to\r\nhimself as he thought how he would hang on to this job!",
        "And then one afternoon, the ninth of his work in the place, when he\r\nwent to get his overcoat he saw a group of men crowded before a placard\r\non the door, and when he went over and asked what it was, they told him\r\nthat beginning with the morrow his department of the harvester works\r\nwould be closed until further notice!",
        "CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was the way they did it!",
        "There was not half an hour’s warning—the\r\nworks were closed!",
        "It had happened that way before, said the men, and\r\nit would happen that way forever.",
        "They had made all the harvesting\r\nmachines that the world needed, and now they had to wait till some wore\r\nout!",
        "It was nobody’s fault—that was the way of it; and thousands of men\r\nand women were turned out in the dead of winter, to live upon their\r\nsavings if they had any, and otherwise to die.",
        "So many tens of\r\nthousands already in the city, homeless and begging for work, and now\r\nseveral thousand more added to them!",
        "Jurgis walked home-with his pittance of pay in his pocket, heartbroken,\r\noverwhelmed.",
        "One more bandage had been torn from his eyes, one more\r\npitfall was revealed to him!",
        "Of what help was kindness and decency on\r\nthe part of employers—when they could not keep a job for him, when\r\nthere were more harvesting machines made than the world was able to\r\nbuy!",
        "What a hellish mockery it was, anyway, that a man should slave to\r\nmake harvesting machines for the country, only to be turned out to\r\nstarve for doing his duty too well!",
        "It took him two days to get over this heart-sickening disappointment.",
        "He did not drink anything, because Elzbieta got his money for\r\nsafekeeping, and knew him too well to be in the least frightened by his\r\nangry demands.",
        "He stayed up in the garret however, and sulked—what was\r\nthe use of a man’s hunting a job when it was taken from him before he\r\nhad time to learn the work?",
        "But then their money was going again, and\r\nlittle Antanas was hungry, and crying with the bitter cold of the\r\ngarret.",
        "Also Madame Haupt, the midwife, was after him for some money.",
        "So he went out once more.",
        "For another ten days he roamed the streets and alleys of the huge city,\r\nsick and hungry, begging for any work.",
        "He tried in stores and offices,\r\nin restaurants and hotels, along the docks and in the railroad yards,\r\nin warehouses and mills and factories where they made products that\r\nwent to every corner of the world.",
        "There were often one or two\r\nchances—but there were always a hundred men for every chance, and his\r\nturn would not come.",
        "At night he crept into sheds and cellars and\r\ndoorways—until there came a spell of belated winter weather, with a\r\nraging gale, and the thermometer five degrees below zero at sundown and\r\nfalling all night.",
        "Then Jurgis fought like a wild beast to get into the\r\nbig Harrison Street police station, and slept down in a corridor,\r\ncrowded with two other men upon a single step.",
        "He had to fight often in these days to fight for a place near the\r\nfactory gates, and now and again with gangs on the street.",
        "He found,\r\nfor instance, that the business of carrying satchels for railroad\r\npassengers was a pre-empted one—whenever he essayed it, eight or ten\r\nmen and boys would fall upon him and force him to run for his life.",
        "They always had the policeman “squared,” and so there was no use in\r\nexpecting protection.",
        "That Jurgis did not starve to death was due solely to the pittance the\r\nchildren brought him.",
        "And even this was never certain.",
        "For one thing\r\nthe cold was almost more than the children could bear; and then they,\r\ntoo, were in perpetual peril from rivals who plundered and beat them.",
        "The law was against them, too—little Vilimas, who was really eleven,\r\nbut did not look to be eight, was stopped on the streets by a severe\r\nold lady in spectacles, who told him that he was too young to be\r\nworking and that if he did not stop selling papers she would send a\r\ntruant officer after him.",
        "Also one night a strange man caught little\r\nKotrina by the arm and tried to persuade her into a dark cellar-way, an\r\nexperience which filled her with such terror that she was hardly to be\r\nkept at work.",
        "At last, on a Sunday, as there was no use looking for work, Jurgis went\r\nhome by stealing rides on the cars.",
        "He found that they had been waiting\r\nfor him for three days—there was a chance of a job for him.",
        "It was quite a story.",
        "Little Juozapas, who was near crazy with hunger\r\nthese days, had gone out on the street to beg for himself.",
        "Juozapas had\r\nonly one leg, having been run over by a wagon when a little child, but\r\nhe had got himself a broomstick, which he put under his arm for a\r\ncrutch.",
        "He had fallen in with some other children and found the way to\r\nMike Scully’s dump, which lay three or four blocks away.",
        "To this place\r\nthere came every day many hundreds of wagon-loads of garbage and trash\r\nfrom the lake front, where the rich people lived; and in the heaps the\r\nchildren raked for food—there were hunks of bread and potato peelings\r\nand apple cores and meat bones, all of it half frozen and quite\r\nunspoiled.",
        "Little Juozapas gorged himself, and came home with a\r\nnewspaper full, which he was feeding to Antanas when his mother came\r\nin.",
        "Elzbieta was horrified, for she did not believe that the food out\r\nof the dumps was fit to eat.",
        "The next day, however, when no harm came\r\nof it and Juozapas began to cry with hunger, she gave in and said that\r\nhe might go again.",
        "And that afternoon he came home with a story of how\r\nwhile he had been digging away with a stick, a lady upon the street had\r\ncalled him.",
        "A real fine lady, the little boy explained, a beautiful\r\nlady; and she wanted to know all about him, and whether he got the\r\ngarbage for chickens, and why he walked with a broomstick, and why Ona\r\nhad died, and how Jurgis had come to go to jail, and what was the\r\nmatter with Marija, and everything.",
        "In the end she had asked where he\r\nlived, and said that she was coming to see him, and bring him a new\r\ncrutch to walk with.",
        "She had on a hat with a bird upon it, Juozapas\r\nadded, and a long fur snake around her neck.",
        "She really came, the very next morning, and climbed the ladder to the\r\ngarret, and stood and stared about her, turning pale at the sight of\r\nthe blood stains on the floor where Ona had died.",
        "She was a “settlement\r\nworker,” she explained to Elzbieta—she lived around on Ashland Avenue.",
        "Elzbieta knew the place, over a feed store; somebody had wanted her to\r\ngo there, but she had not cared to, for she thought that it must have\r\nsomething to do with religion, and the priest did not like her to have\r\nanything to do with strange religions.",
        "They were rich people who came\r\nto live there to find out about the poor people; but what good they\r\nexpected it would do them to know, one could not imagine.",
        "So spoke\r\nElzbieta, naïvely, and the young lady laughed and was rather at a loss\r\nfor an answer—she stood and gazed about her, and thought of a cynical\r\nremark that had been made to her, that she was standing upon the brink\r\nof the pit of hell and throwing in snowballs to lower the temperature.",
        "Elzbieta was glad to have somebody to listen, and she told all their\r\nwoes—what had happened to Ona, and the jail, and the loss of their\r\nhome, and Marija’s accident, and how Ona had died, and how Jurgis could\r\nget no work.",
        "As she listened the pretty young lady’s eyes filled with\r\ntears, and in the midst of it she burst into weeping and hid her face\r\non Elzbieta’s shoulder, quite regardless of the fact that the woman had\r\non a dirty old wrapper and that the garret was full of fleas.",
        "Poor\r\nElzbieta was ashamed of herself for having told so woeful a tale, and\r\nthe other had to beg and plead with her to get her to go on.",
        "The end of\r\nit was that the young lady sent them a basket of things to eat, and\r\nleft a letter that Jurgis was to take to a gentleman who was\r\nsuperintendent in one of the mills of the great steelworks in South\r\nChicago.",
        "“He will get Jurgis something to do,” the young lady had said,\r\nand added, smiling through her tears—“If he doesn’t, he will never\r\nmarry me.”\r\n\r\nThe steel-works were fifteen miles away, and as usual it was so\r\ncontrived that one had to pay two fares to get there.",
        "Far and wide the\r\nsky was flaring with the red glare that leaped from rows of towering\r\nchimneys—for it was pitch dark when Jurgis arrived.",
        "The vast works, a\r\ncity in themselves, were surrounded by a stockade; and already a full\r\nhundred men were waiting at the gate where new hands were taken on.",
        "Soon after daybreak whistles began to blow, and then suddenly thousands\r\nof men appeared, streaming from saloons and boardinghouses across the\r\nway, leaping from trolley cars that passed—it seemed as if they rose\r\nout of the ground, in the dim gray light.",
        "A river of them poured in\r\nthrough the gate—and then gradually ebbed away again, until there were\r\nonly a few late ones running, and the watchman pacing up and down, and\r\nthe hungry strangers stamping and shivering.",
        "Jurgis presented his precious letter.",
        "The gatekeeper was surly, and put\r\nhim through a catechism, but he insisted that he knew nothing, and as\r\nhe had taken the precaution to seal his letter, there was nothing for\r\nthe gatekeeper to do but send it to the person to whom it was\r\naddressed.",
        "A messenger came back to say that Jurgis should wait, and so\r\nhe came inside of the gate, perhaps not sorry enough that there were\r\nothers less fortunate watching him with greedy eyes.",
        "The great mills\r\nwere getting under way—one could hear a vast stirring, a rolling and\r\nrumbling and hammering.",
        "Little by little the scene grew plain:\r\ntowering, black buildings here and there, long rows of shops and sheds,\r\nlittle railways branching everywhere, bare gray cinders underfoot and\r\noceans of billowing black smoke above.",
        "On one side of the grounds ran a\r\nrailroad with a dozen tracks, and on the other side lay the lake, where\r\nsteamers came to load.",
        "Jurgis had time enough to stare and speculate, for it was two hours\r\nbefore he was summoned.",
        "He went into the office building, where a\r\ncompany timekeeper interviewed him.",
        "The superintendent was busy, he\r\nsaid, but he (the timekeeper) would try to find Jurgis a job.",
        "He had\r\nnever worked in a steel mill before?",
        "But he was ready for anything?",
        "Well, then, they would go and see.",
        "So they began a tour, among sights that made Jurgis stare amazed.",
        "He\r\nwondered if ever he could get used to working in a place like this,\r\nwhere the air shook with deafening thunder, and whistles shrieked\r\nwarnings on all sides of him at once; where miniature steam engines\r\ncame rushing upon him, and sizzling, quivering, white-hot masses of\r\nmetal sped past him, and explosions of fire and flaming sparks dazzled\r\nhim and scorched his face.",
        "The men in these mills were all black with\r\nsoot, and hollow-eyed and gaunt; they worked with fierce intensity,\r\nrushing here and there, and never lifting their eyes from their tasks.",
        "Jurgis clung to his guide like a scared child to its nurse, and while\r\nthe latter hailed one foreman after another to ask if they could use\r\nanother unskilled man, he stared about him and marveled.",
        "He was taken to the Bessemer furnace, where they made billets of\r\nsteel—a dome-like building, the size of a big theater.",
        "Jurgis stood\r\nwhere the balcony of the theater would have been, and opposite, by the\r\nstage, he saw three giant caldrons, big enough for all the devils of\r\nhell to brew their broth in, full of something white and blinding,\r\nbubbling and splashing, roaring as if volcanoes were blowing through\r\nit—one had to shout to be heard in the place.",
        "Liquid fire would leap\r\nfrom these caldrons and scatter like bombs below—and men were working\r\nthere, seeming careless, so that Jurgis caught his breath with fright.",
        "Then a whistle would toot, and across the curtain of the theater would\r\ncome a little engine with a carload of something to be dumped into one\r\nof the receptacles; and then another whistle would toot, down by the\r\nstage, and another train would back up—and suddenly, without an\r\ninstant’s warning, one of the giant kettles began to tilt and topple,\r\nflinging out a jet of hissing, roaring flame.",
        "Jurgis shrank back\r\nappalled, for he thought it was an accident; there fell a pillar of\r\nwhite flame, dazzling as the sun, swishing like a huge tree falling in\r\nthe forest.",
        "A torrent of sparks swept all the way across the building,\r\noverwhelming everything, hiding it from sight; and then Jurgis looked\r\nthrough the fingers of his hands, and saw pouring out of the caldron a\r\ncascade of living, leaping fire, white with a whiteness not of earth,\r\nscorching the eyeballs.",
        "Incandescent rainbows shone above it, blue,\r\nred, and golden lights played about it; but the stream itself was\r\nwhite, ineffable.",
        "Out of regions of wonder it streamed, the very river\r\nof life; and the soul leaped up at the sight of it, fled back upon it,\r\nswift and resistless, back into far-off lands, where beauty and terror\r\ndwell.",
        "Then the great caldron tilted back again, empty, and Jurgis saw\r\nto his relief that no one was hurt, and turned and followed his guide\r\nout into the sunlight.",
        "They went through the blast furnaces, through rolling mills where bars\r\nof steel were tossed about and chopped like bits of cheese.",
        "All around\r\nand above giant machine arms were flying, giant wheels were turning,\r\ngreat hammers crashing; traveling cranes creaked and groaned overhead,\r\nreaching down iron hands and seizing iron prey—it was like standing in\r\nthe center of the earth, where the machinery of time was revolving.",
        "By and by they came to the place where steel rails were made; and\r\nJurgis heard a toot behind him, and jumped out of the way of a car with\r\na white-hot ingot upon it, the size of a man’s body.",
        "There was a sudden\r\ncrash and the car came to a halt, and the ingot toppled out upon a\r\nmoving platform, where steel fingers and arms seized hold of it,\r\npunching it and prodding it into place, and hurrying it into the grip\r\nof huge rollers.",
        "Then it came out upon the other side, and there were\r\nmore crashings and clatterings, and over it was flopped, like a pancake\r\non a gridiron, and seized again and rushed back at you through another\r\nsqueezer.",
        "So amid deafening uproar it clattered to and fro, growing\r\nthinner and flatter and longer.",
        "The ingot seemed almost a living thing;\r\nit did not want to run this mad course, but it was in the grip of fate,\r\nit was tumbled on, screeching and clanking and shivering in protest.",
        "By\r\nand by it was long and thin, a great red snake escaped from purgatory;\r\nand then, as it slid through the rollers, you would have sworn that it\r\nwas alive—it writhed and squirmed, and wriggles and shudders passed out\r\nthrough its tail, all but flinging it off by their violence.",
        "There was\r\nno rest for it until it was cold and black—and then it needed only to\r\nbe cut and straightened to be ready for a railroad.",
        "It was at the end of this rail’s progress that Jurgis got his chance.",
        "They had to be moved by men with crowbars, and the boss here could use\r\nanother man.",
        "So he took off his coat and set to work on the spot.",
        "It took him two hours to get to this place every day and cost him a\r\ndollar and twenty cents a week.",
        "As this was out of the question, he\r\nwrapped his bedding in a bundle and took it with him, and one of his\r\nfellow workingmen introduced him to a Polish lodging-house, where he\r\nmight have the privilege of sleeping upon the floor for ten cents a\r\nnight.",
        "He got his meals at free-lunch counters, and every Saturday\r\nnight he went home—bedding and all—and took the greater part of his\r\nmoney to the family.",
        "Elzbieta was sorry for this arrangement, for she\r\nfeared that it would get him into the habit of living without them, and\r\nonce a week was not very often for him to see his baby; but there was\r\nno other way of arranging it.",
        "There was no chance for a woman at the\r\nsteelworks, and Marija was now ready for work again, and lured on from\r\nday to day by the hope of finding it at the yards.",
        "In a week Jurgis got over his sense of helplessness and bewilderment in\r\nthe rail mill.",
        "He learned to find his way about and to take all the\r\nmiracles and terrors for granted, to work without hearing the rumbling\r\nand crashing.",
        "From blind fear he went to the other extreme; he became\r\nreckless and indifferent, like all the rest of the men, who took but\r\nlittle thought of themselves in the ardor of their work.",
        "It was\r\nwonderful, when one came to think of it, that these men should have\r\ntaken an interest in the work they did—they had no share in it—they\r\nwere paid by the hour, and paid no more for being interested.",
        "Also they\r\nknew that if they were hurt they would be flung aside and forgotten—and\r\nstill they would hurry to their task by dangerous short cuts, would use\r\nmethods that were quicker and more effective in spite of the fact that\r\nthey were also risky.",
        "His fourth day at his work Jurgis saw a man\r\nstumble while running in front of a car, and have his foot mashed off,\r\nand before he had been there three weeks he was witness of a yet more\r\ndreadful accident.",
        "There was a row of brick furnaces, shining white\r\nthrough every crack with the molten steel inside.",
        "Some of these were\r\nbulging dangerously, yet men worked before them, wearing blue glasses\r\nwhen they opened and shut the doors.",
        "One morning as Jurgis was passing,\r\na furnace blew out, spraying two men with a shower of liquid fire.",
        "As\r\nthey lay screaming and rolling upon the ground in agony, Jurgis rushed\r\nto help them, and as a result he lost a good part of the skin from the\r\ninside of one of his hands.",
        "The company doctor bandaged it up, but he\r\ngot no other thanks from any one, and was laid up for eight working\r\ndays without any pay.",
        "Most fortunately, at this juncture, Elzbieta got the long-awaited\r\nchance to go at five o’clock in the morning and help scrub the office\r\nfloors of one of the packers.",
        "Jurgis came home and covered himself with\r\nblankets to keep warm, and divided his time between sleeping and\r\nplaying with little Antanas.",
        "Juozapas was away raking in the dump a\r\ngood part of the time, and Elzbieta and Marija were hunting for more\r\nwork.",
        "Antanas was now over a year and a half old, and was a perfect talking\r\nmachine.",
        "He learned so fast that every week when Jurgis came home it\r\nseemed to him as if he had a new child.",
        "He would sit down and listen\r\nand stare at him, and give vent to delighted exclamations—“_Palauk!",
        "Muma!",
        "Tu mano szirdele!_” The little fellow was now really the one\r\ndelight that Jurgis had in the world—his one hope, his one victory.",
        "Thank God, Antanas was a boy!",
        "And he was as tough as a pine knot, and\r\nwith the appetite of a wolf.",
        "Nothing had hurt him, and nothing could\r\nhurt him; he had come through all the suffering and deprivation\r\nunscathed—only shriller-voiced and more determined in his grip upon\r\nlife.",
        "He was a terrible child to manage, was Antanas, but his father\r\ndid not mind that—he would watch him and smile to himself with\r\nsatisfaction.",
        "The more of a fighter he was the better—he would need to\r\nfight before he got through.",
        "Jurgis had got the habit of buying the Sunday paper whenever he had the\r\nmoney; a most wonderful paper could be had for only five cents, a whole\r\narmful, with all the news of the world set forth in big headlines, that\r\nJurgis could spell out slowly, with the children to help him at the\r\nlong words.",
        "There was battle and murder and sudden death—it was\r\nmarvelous how they ever heard about so many entertaining and thrilling\r\nhappenings; the stories must be all true, for surely no man could have\r\nmade such things up, and besides, there were pictures of them all, as\r\nreal as life.",
        "One of these papers was as good as a circus, and nearly\r\nas good as a spree—certainly a most wonderful treat for a workingman,\r\nwho was tired out and stupefied, and had never had any education, and\r\nwhose work was one dull, sordid grind, day after day, and year after\r\nyear, with never a sight of a green field nor an hour’s entertainment,\r\nnor anything but liquor to stimulate his imagination.",
        "Among other\r\nthings, these papers had pages full of comical pictures, and these were\r\nthe main joy in life to little Antanas.",
        "He treasured them up, and would\r\ndrag them out and make his father tell him about them; there were all\r\nsorts of animals among them, and Antanas could tell the names of all of\r\nthem, lying upon the floor for hours and pointing them out with his\r\nchubby little fingers.",
        "Whenever the story was plain enough for Jurgis\r\nto make out, Antanas would have it repeated to him, and then he would\r\nremember it, prattling funny little sentences and mixing it up with\r\nother stories in an irresistible fashion.",
        "Also his quaint pronunciation\r\nof words was such a delight—and the phrases he would pick up and\r\nremember, the most outlandish and impossible things!",
        "The first time\r\nthat the little rascal burst out with “God damn,” his father nearly\r\nrolled off the chair with glee; but in the end he was sorry for this,\r\nfor Antanas was soon “God-damning” everything and everybody.",
        "And then, when he was able to use his hands, Jurgis took his bedding\r\nagain and went back to his task of shifting rails.",
        "It was now April,\r\nand the snow had given place to cold rains, and the unpaved street in\r\nfront of Aniele’s house was turned into a canal.",
        "Jurgis would have to\r\nwade through it to get home, and if it was late he might easily get\r\nstuck to his waist in the mire.",
        "But he did not mind this much—it was a\r\npromise that summer was coming.",
        "Marija had now gotten a place as\r\nbeef-trimmer in one of the smaller packing plants; and he told himself\r\nthat he had learned his lesson now, and would meet with no more\r\naccidents—so that at last there was prospect of an end to their long\r\nagony.",
        "They could save money again, and when another winter came they\r\nwould have a comfortable place; and the children would be off the\r\nstreets and in school again, and they might set to work to nurse back\r\ninto life their habits of decency and kindness.",
        "So once more Jurgis\r\nbegan to make plans and dream dreams.",
        "And then one Saturday night he jumped off the car and started home,\r\nwith the sun shining low under the edge of a bank of clouds that had\r\nbeen pouring floods of water into the mud-soaked street.",
        "There was a\r\nrainbow in the sky, and another in his breast—for he had thirty-six\r\nhours’ rest before him, and a chance to see his family.",
        "Then suddenly\r\nhe came in sight of the house, and noticed that there was a crowd\r\nbefore the door.",
        "He ran up the steps and pushed his way in, and saw\r\nAniele’s kitchen crowded with excited women.",
        "It reminded him so vividly\r\nof the time when he had come home from jail and found Ona dying, that\r\nhis heart almost stood still.",
        "“What’s the matter?” he cried.",
        "A dead silence had fallen in the room, and he saw that every one was\r\nstaring at him.",
        "“What’s the matter?” he exclaimed again.",
        "And then, up in the garret, he heard sounds of wailing, in Marija’s\r\nvoice.",
        "He started for the ladder—and Aniele seized him by the arm.",
        "“No,\r\nno!” she exclaimed.",
        "“Don’t go up there!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he shouted.",
        "And the old woman answered him weakly: “It’s Antanas.",
        "He’s dead.",
        "He was\r\ndrowned out in the street!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis took the news in a peculiar way.",
        "He turned deadly pale, but he\r\ncaught himself, and for half a minute stood in the middle of the room,\r\nclenching his hands tightly and setting his teeth.",
        "Then he pushed\r\nAniele aside and strode into the next room and climbed the ladder.",
        "In the corner was a blanket, with a form half showing beneath it; and\r\nbeside it lay Elzbieta, whether crying or in a faint, Jurgis could not\r\ntell.",
        "Marija was pacing the room, screaming and wringing her hands.",
        "He\r\nclenched his hands tighter yet, and his voice was hard as he spoke.",
        "“How did it happen?” he asked.",
        "Marija scarcely heard him in her agony.",
        "He repeated the question,\r\nlouder and yet more harshly.",
        "“He fell off the sidewalk!” she wailed.",
        "The sidewalk in front of the house was a platform made of half-rotten\r\nboards, about five feet above the level of the sunken street.",
        "“How did he come to be there?” he demanded.",
        "“He went—he went out to play,” Marija sobbed, her voice choking her.",
        "“We couldn’t make him stay in.",
        "He must have got caught in the mud!”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure that he is dead?” he demanded.",
        "“Ai!",
        "ai!” she wailed.",
        "“Yes; we had the doctor.”\r\n\r\nThen Jurgis stood a few seconds, wavering.",
        "He did not shed a tear.",
        "He\r\ntook one glance more at the blanket with the little form beneath it,\r\nand then turned suddenly to the ladder and climbed down again.",
        "A\r\nsilence fell once more in the room as he entered.",
        "He went straight to\r\nthe door, passed out, and started down the street.",
        "When his wife had died, Jurgis made for the nearest saloon, but he did\r\nnot do that now, though he had his week’s wages in his pocket.",
        "He\r\nwalked and walked, seeing nothing, splashing through mud and water.",
        "Later on he sat down upon a step and hid his face in his hands and for\r\nhalf an hour or so he did not move.",
        "Now and then he would whisper to\r\nhimself: “Dead!",
        "_Dead!_”\r\n\r\nFinally, he got up and walked on again.",
        "It was about sunset, and he\r\nwent on and on until it was dark, when he was stopped by a railroad\r\ncrossing.",
        "The gates were down, and a long train of freight cars was\r\nthundering by.",
        "He stood and watched it; and all at once a wild impulse\r\nseized him, a thought that had been lurking within him, unspoken,\r\nunrecognized, leaped into sudden life.",
        "He started down the track, and\r\nwhen he was past the gate-keeper’s shanty he sprang forward and swung\r\nhimself on to one of the cars.",
        "By and by the train stopped again, and Jurgis sprang down and ran under\r\nthe car, and hid himself upon the truck.",
        "Here he sat, and when the\r\ntrain started again, he fought a battle with his soul.",
        "He gripped his\r\nhands and set his teeth together—he had not wept, and he would not—not\r\na tear!",
        "It was past and over, and he was done with it—he would fling it\r\noff his shoulders, be free of it, the whole business, that night.",
        "It\r\nshould go like a black, hateful nightmare, and in the morning he would\r\nbe a new man.",
        "And every time that a thought of it assailed him—a tender\r\nmemory, a trace of a tear—he rose up, cursing with rage, and pounded it\r\ndown.",
        "He was fighting for his life; he gnashed his teeth together in his\r\ndesperation.",
        "He had been a fool, a fool!",
        "He had wasted his life, he had\r\nwrecked himself, with his accursed weakness; and now he was done with\r\nit—he would tear it out of him, root and branch!",
        "There should be no\r\nmore tears and no more tenderness; he had had enough of them—they had\r\nsold him into slavery!",
        "Now he was going to be free, to tear off his\r\nshackles, to rise up and fight.",
        "He was glad that the end had come—it\r\nhad to come some time, and it was just as well now.",
        "This was no world\r\nfor women and children, and the sooner they got out of it the better\r\nfor them.",
        "Whatever Antanas might suffer where he was, he could suffer\r\nno more than he would have had he stayed upon earth.",
        "And meantime his\r\nfather had thought the last thought about him that he meant to; he was\r\ngoing to think of himself, he was going to fight for himself, against\r\nthe world that had baffled him and tortured him!",
        "So he went on, tearing up all the flowers from the garden of his soul,\r\nand setting his heel upon them.",
        "The train thundered deafeningly, and a\r\nstorm of dust blew in his face; but though it stopped now and then\r\nthrough the night, he clung where he was—he would cling there until he\r\nwas driven off, for every mile that he got from Packingtown meant\r\nanother load from his mind.",
        "Whenever the cars stopped a warm breeze blew upon him, a breeze laden\r\nwith the perfume of fresh fields, of honeysuckle and clover.",
        "He snuffed\r\nit, and it made his heart beat wildly—he was out in the country again!",
        "He was going to _live_ in the country!",
        "When the dawn came he was\r\npeering out with hungry eyes, getting glimpses of meadows and woods and\r\nrivers.",
        "At last he could stand it no longer, and when the train stopped\r\nagain he crawled out.",
        "Upon the top of the car was a brakeman, who shook\r\nhis fist and swore; Jurgis waved his hand derisively, and started\r\nacross the country.",
        "Only think that he had been a countryman all his life; and for three\r\nlong years he had never seen a country sight nor heard a country sound!",
        "Excepting for that one walk when he left jail, when he was too much\r\nworried to notice anything, and for a few times that he had rested in\r\nthe city parks in the winter time when he was out of work, he had\r\nliterally never seen a tree!",
        "And now he felt like a bird lifted up and\r\nborne away upon a gale; he stopped and stared at each new sight of\r\nwonder—at a herd of cows, and a meadow full of daisies, at hedgerows\r\nset thick with June roses, at little birds singing in the trees.",
        "Then he came to a farm-house, and after getting himself a stick for\r\nprotection, he approached it.",
        "The farmer was greasing a wagon in front\r\nof the barn, and Jurgis went to him.",
        "“I would like to get some\r\nbreakfast, please,” he said.",
        "“Do you want to work?” said the farmer.",
        "“No,” said Jurgis.",
        "“I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Then you can’t get anything here,” snapped the other.",
        "“I meant to pay for it,” said Jurgis.",
        "“Oh,” said the farmer; and then added sarcastically, “We don’t serve\r\nbreakfast after 7 A.M.”\r\n\r\n“I am very hungry,” said Jurgis gravely; “I would like to buy some\r\nfood.”\r\n\r\n“Ask the woman,” said the farmer, nodding over his shoulder.",
        "The\r\n“woman” was more tractable, and for a dime Jurgis secured two thick\r\nsandwiches and a piece of pie and two apples.",
        "He walked off eating the\r\npie, as the least convenient thing to carry.",
        "In a few minutes he came\r\nto a stream, and he climbed a fence and walked down the bank, along a\r\nwoodland path.",
        "By and by he found a comfortable spot, and there he\r\ndevoured his meal, slaking his thirst at the stream.",
        "Then he lay for\r\nhours, just gazing and drinking in joy; until at last he felt sleepy,\r\nand lay down in the shade of a bush.",
        "When he awoke the sun was shining hot in his face.",
        "He sat up and\r\nstretched his arms, and then gazed at the water sliding by.",
        "There was a\r\ndeep pool, sheltered and silent, below him, and a sudden wonderful idea\r\nrushed upon him.",
        "He might have a bath!",
        "The water was free, and he might\r\nget into it—all the way into it!",
        "It would be the first time that he had\r\nbeen all the way into the water since he left Lithuania!",
        "When Jurgis had first come to the stockyards he had been as clean as\r\nany workingman could well be.",
        "But later on, what with sickness and cold\r\nand hunger and discouragement, and the filthiness of his work, and the\r\nvermin in his home, he had given up washing in winter, and in summer\r\nonly as much of him as would go into a basin.",
        "He had had a shower bath\r\nin jail, but nothing since—and now he would have a swim!",
        "The water was warm, and he splashed about like a very boy in his glee.",
        "Afterward he sat down in the water near the bank, and proceeded to\r\nscrub himself—soberly and methodically, scouring every inch of him with\r\nsand.",
        "While he was doing it he would do it thoroughly, and see how it\r\nfelt to be clean.",
        "He even scrubbed his head with sand, and combed what\r\nthe men called “crumbs” out of his long, black hair, holding his head\r\nunder water as long as he could, to see if he could not kill them all.",
        "Then, seeing that the sun was still hot, he took his clothes from the\r\nbank and proceeded to wash them, piece by piece; as the dirt and grease\r\nwent floating off downstream he grunted with satisfaction and soused\r\nthe clothes again, venturing even to dream that he might get rid of the\r\nfertilizer.",
        "He hung them all up, and while they were drying he lay down in the sun\r\nand had another long sleep.",
        "They were hot and stiff as boards on top,\r\nand a little damp on the underside, when he awakened; but being hungry,\r\nhe put them on and set out again.",
        "He had no knife, but with some labor\r\nhe broke himself a good stout club, and, armed with this, he marched\r\ndown the road again.",
        "Before long he came to a big farmhouse, and turned up the lane that led\r\nto it.",
        "It was just supper-time, and the farmer was washing his hands at\r\nthe kitchen door.",
        "“Please, sir,” said Jurgis, “can I have something to\r\neat?",
        "I can pay.” To which the farmer responded promptly, “We don’t feed\r\ntramps here.",
        "Get out!”\r\n\r\nJurgis went without a word; but as he passed round the barn he came to\r\na freshly ploughed and harrowed field, in which the farmer had set out\r\nsome young peach trees; and as he walked he jerked up a row of them by\r\nthe roots, more than a hundred trees in all, before he reached the end\r\nof the field.",
        "That was his answer, and it showed his mood; from now on\r\nhe was fighting, and the man who hit him would get all that he gave,\r\nevery time.",
        "Beyond the orchard Jurgis struck through a patch of woods, and then a\r\nfield of winter grain, and came at last to another road.",
        "Before long he\r\nsaw another farmhouse, and, as it was beginning to cloud over a little,\r\nhe asked here for shelter as well as food.",
        "Seeing the farmer eying him\r\ndubiously, he added, “I’ll be glad to sleep in the barn.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I dunno,” said the other.",
        "“Do you smoke?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” said Jurgis, “but I’ll do it out of doors.” When the man\r\nhad assented, he inquired, “How much will it cost me?",
        "I haven’t very\r\nmuch money.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon about twenty cents for supper,” replied the farmer.",
        "“I won’t\r\ncharge ye for the barn.”\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis went in, and sat down at the table with the farmer’s wife and\r\nhalf a dozen children.",
        "It was a bountiful meal—there were baked beans\r\nand mashed potatoes and asparagus chopped and stewed, and a dish of\r\nstrawberries, and great, thick slices of bread, and a pitcher of milk.",
        "Jurgis had not had such a feast since his wedding day, and he made a\r\nmighty effort to put in his twenty cents’ worth.",
        "They were all of them too hungry to talk; but afterward they sat upon\r\nthe steps and smoked, and the farmer questioned his guest.",
        "When Jurgis\r\nhad explained that he was a workingman from Chicago, and that he did\r\nnot know just whither he was bound, the other said, “Why don’t you stay\r\nhere and work for me?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not looking for work just now,” Jurgis answered.",
        "“I’ll pay ye good,” said the other, eying his big form—“a dollar a day\r\nand board ye.",
        "Help’s terrible scarce round here.”\r\n\r\n“Is that winter as well as summer?” Jurgis demanded quickly.",
        "“N—no,” said the farmer; “I couldn’t keep ye after November—I ain’t got\r\na big enough place for that.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the other, “that’s what I thought.",
        "When you get through\r\nworking your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?”\r\n(Jurgis was beginning to think for himself nowadays.)\r\n\r\n“It ain’t quite the same,” the farmer answered, seeing the point.",
        "“There ought to be work a strong fellow like you can find to do, in the\r\ncities, or some place, in the winter time.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jurgis, “that’s what they all think; and so they crowd into\r\nthe cities, and when they have to beg or steal to live, then people ask\r\n’em why they don’t go into the country, where help is scarce.” The\r\nfarmer meditated awhile.",
        "“How about when your money’s gone?” he inquired, finally.",
        "“You’ll have\r\nto, then, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Wait till she’s gone,” said Jurgis; “then I’ll see.”\r\n\r\nHe had a long sleep in the barn and then a big breakfast of coffee and\r\nbread and oatmeal and stewed cherries, for which the man charged him\r\nonly fifteen cents, perhaps having been influenced by his arguments.",
        "Then Jurgis bade farewell, and went on his way.",
        "Such was the beginning of his life as a tramp.",
        "It was seldom he got as\r\nfair treatment as from this last farmer, and so as time went on he\r\nlearned to shun the houses and to prefer sleeping in the fields.",
        "When\r\nit rained he would find a deserted building, if he could, and if not,\r\nhe would wait until after dark and then, with his stick ready, begin a\r\nstealthy approach upon a barn.",
        "Generally he could get in before the dog\r\ngot scent of him, and then he would hide in the hay and be safe until\r\nmorning; if not, and the dog attacked him, he would rise up and make a\r\nretreat in battle order.",
        "Jurgis was not the mighty man he had once\r\nbeen, but his arms were still good, and there were few farm dogs he\r\nneeded to hit more than once.",
        "Before long there came raspberries, and then blackberries, to help him\r\nsave his money; and there were apples in the orchards and potatoes in\r\nthe ground—he learned to note the places and fill his pockets after\r\ndark.",
        "Twice he even managed to capture a chicken, and had a feast, once\r\nin a deserted barn and the other time in a lonely spot alongside of a\r\nstream.",
        "When all of these things failed him he used his money\r\ncarefully, but without worry—for he saw that he could earn more\r\nwhenever he chose.",
        "Half an hour’s chopping wood in his lively fashion\r\nwas enough to bring him a meal, and when the farmer had seen him\r\nworking he would sometimes try to bribe him to stay.",
        "But Jurgis was not staying.",
        "He was a free man now, a buccaneer.",
        "The old\r\n_Wanderlust_ had got into his blood, the joy of the unbound life, the\r\njoy of seeking, of hoping without limit.",
        "There were mishaps and\r\ndiscomforts—but at least there was always something new; and only think\r\nwhat it meant to a man who for years had been penned up in one place,\r\nseeing nothing but one dreary prospect of shanties and factories, to be\r\nsuddenly set loose beneath the open sky, to behold new landscapes, new\r\nplaces, and new people every hour!",
        "To a man whose whole life had\r\nconsisted of doing one certain thing all day, until he was so exhausted\r\nthat he could only lie down and sleep until the next day—and to be now\r\nhis own master, working as he pleased and when he pleased, and facing a\r\nnew adventure every hour!",
        "Then, too, his health came back to him, all his lost youthful vigor,\r\nhis joy and power that he had mourned and forgotten!",
        "It came with a\r\nsudden rush, bewildering him, startling him; it was as if his dead\r\nchildhood had come back to him, laughing and calling!",
        "What with plenty\r\nto eat and fresh air and exercise that was taken as it pleased him, he\r\nwould waken from his sleep and start off not knowing what to do with\r\nhis energy, stretching his arms, laughing, singing old songs of home\r\nthat came back to him.",
        "Now and then, of course, he could not help but\r\nthink of little Antanas, whom he should never see again, whose little\r\nvoice he should never hear; and then he would have to battle with\r\nhimself.",
        "Sometimes at night he would waken dreaming of Ona, and stretch\r\nout his arms to her, and wet the ground with his tears.",
        "But in the\r\nmorning he would get up and shake himself, and stride away again to\r\nbattle with the world.",
        "He never asked where he was nor where he was going; the country was big\r\nenough, he knew, and there was no danger of his coming to the end of\r\nit.",
        "And of course he could always have company for the\r\nasking—everywhere he went there were men living just as he lived, and\r\nwhom he was welcome to join.",
        "He was a stranger at the business, but\r\nthey were not clannish, and they taught him all their tricks—what towns\r\nand villages it was best to keep away from, and how to read the secret\r\nsigns upon the fences, and when to beg and when to steal, and just how\r\nto do both.",
        "They laughed at his ideas of paying for anything with money\r\nor with work—for they got all they wanted without either.",
        "Now and then\r\nJurgis camped out with a gang of them in some woodland haunt, and\r\nforaged with them in the neighborhood at night.",
        "And then among them\r\nsome one would “take a shine” to him, and they would go off together\r\nand travel for a week, exchanging reminiscences.",
        "Of these professional tramps a great many had, of course, been\r\nshiftless and vicious all their lives.",
        "But the vast majority of them\r\nhad been workingmen, had fought the long fight as Jurgis had, and found\r\nthat it was a losing fight, and given up.",
        "Later on he encountered yet\r\nanother sort of men, those from whose ranks the tramps were recruited,\r\nmen who were homeless and wandering, but still seeking work—seeking it\r\nin the harvest fields.",
        "Of these there was an army, the huge surplus\r\nlabor army of society; called into being under the stern system of\r\nnature, to do the casual work of the world, the tasks which were\r\ntransient and irregular, and yet which had to be done.",
        "They did not\r\nknow that they were such, of course; they only knew that they sought\r\nthe job, and that the job was fleeting.",
        "In the early summer they would\r\nbe in Texas, and as the crops were ready they would follow north with\r\nthe season, ending with the fall in Manitoba.",
        "Then they would seek out\r\nthe big lumber camps, where there was winter work; or failing in this,\r\nwould drift to the cities, and live upon what they had managed to save,\r\nwith the help of such transient work as was there the loading and\r\nunloading of steamships and drays, the digging of ditches and the\r\nshoveling of snow.",
        "If there were more of them on hand than chanced to\r\nbe needed, the weaker ones died off of cold and hunger, again according\r\nto the stern system of nature.",
        "It was in the latter part of July, when Jurgis was in Missouri, that he\r\ncame upon the harvest work.",
        "Here were crops that men had worked for\r\nthree or four months to prepare, and of which they would lose nearly\r\nall unless they could find others to help them for a week or two.",
        "So\r\nall over the land there was a cry for labor—agencies were set up and\r\nall the cities were drained of men, even college boys were brought by\r\nthe carload, and hordes of frantic farmers would hold up trains and\r\ncarry off wagon-loads of men by main force.",
        "Not that they did not pay\r\nthem well—any man could get two dollars a day and his board, and the\r\nbest men could get two dollars and a half or three.",
        "The harvest-fever was in the very air, and no man with any spirit in\r\nhim could be in that region and not catch it.",
        "Jurgis joined a gang and\r\nworked from dawn till dark, eighteen hours a day, for two weeks without\r\na break.",
        "Then he had a sum of money that would have been a fortune to\r\nhim in the old days of misery—but what could he do with it now?",
        "To be\r\nsure he might have put it in a bank, and, if he were fortunate, get it\r\nback again when he wanted it.",
        "But Jurgis was now a homeless man,\r\nwandering over a continent; and what did he know about banking and\r\ndrafts and letters of credit?",
        "If he carried the money about with him,\r\nhe would surely be robbed in the end; and so what was there for him to\r\ndo but enjoy it while he could?",
        "On a Saturday night he drifted into a\r\ntown with his fellows; and because it was raining, and there was no\r\nother place provided for him, he went to a saloon.",
        "And there were some\r\nwho treated him and whom he had to treat, and there was laughter and\r\nsinging and good cheer; and then out of the rear part of the saloon a\r\ngirl’s face, red-cheeked and merry, smiled at Jurgis, and his heart\r\nthumped suddenly in his throat.",
        "He nodded to her, and she came and sat\r\nby him, and they had more drink, and then he went upstairs into a room\r\nwith her, and the wild beast rose up within him and screamed, as it has\r\nscreamed in the Jungle from the dawn of time.",
        "And then because of his\r\nmemories and his shame, he was glad when others joined them, men and\r\nwomen; and they had more drink and spent the night in wild rioting and\r\ndebauchery.",
        "In the van of the surplus-labor army, there followed\r\nanother, an army of women, they also struggling for life under the\r\nstern system of nature.",
        "Because there were rich men who sought\r\npleasure, there had been ease and plenty for them so long as they were\r\nyoung and beautiful; and later on, when they were crowded out by others\r\nyounger and more beautiful, they went out to follow upon the trail of\r\nthe workingmen.",
        "Sometimes they came of themselves, and the\r\nsaloon-keepers shared with them; or sometimes they were handled by\r\nagencies, the same as the labor army.",
        "They were in the towns in harvest\r\ntime, near the lumber camps in the winter, in the cities when the men\r\ncame there; if a regiment were encamped, or a railroad or canal being\r\nmade, or a great exposition getting ready, the crowd of women were on\r\nhand, living in shanties or saloons or tenement rooms, sometimes eight\r\nor ten of them together.",
        "In the morning Jurgis had not a cent, and he went out upon the road\r\nagain.",
        "He was sick and disgusted, but after the new plan of his life,\r\nhe crushed his feelings down.",
        "He had made a fool of himself, but he\r\ncould not help it now—all he could do was to see that it did not happen\r\nagain.",
        "So he tramped on until exercise and fresh air banished his\r\nheadache, and his strength and joy returned.",
        "This happened to him every\r\ntime, for Jurgis was still a creature of impulse, and his pleasures had\r\nnot yet become business.",
        "It would be a long time before he could be\r\nlike the majority of these men of the road, who roamed until the hunger\r\nfor drink and for women mastered them, and then went to work with a\r\npurpose in mind, and stopped when they had the price of a spree.",
        "On the contrary, try as he would, Jurgis could not help being made\r\nmiserable by his conscience.",
        "It was the ghost that would not down.",
        "It\r\nwould come upon him in the most unexpected places—sometimes it fairly\r\ndrove him to drink.",
        "One night he was caught by a thunderstorm, and he sought shelter in a\r\nlittle house just outside of a town.",
        "It was a working-man’s home, and\r\nthe owner was a Slav like himself, a new emigrant from White Russia; he\r\nbade Jurgis welcome in his home language, and told him to come to the\r\nkitchen-fire and dry himself.",
        "He had no bed for him, but there was\r\nstraw in the garret, and he could make out.",
        "The man’s wife was cooking\r\nthe supper, and their children were playing about on the floor.",
        "Jurgis\r\nsat and exchanged thoughts with him about the old country, and the\r\nplaces where they had been and the work they had done.",
        "Then they ate,\r\nand afterward sat and smoked and talked more about America, and how\r\nthey found it.",
        "In the middle of a sentence, however, Jurgis stopped,\r\nseeing that the woman had brought a big basin of water and was\r\nproceeding to undress her youngest baby.",
        "The rest had crawled into the\r\ncloset where they slept, but the baby was to have a bath, the\r\nworkingman explained.",
        "The nights had begun to be chilly, and his\r\nmother, ignorant as to the climate in America, had sewed him up for the\r\nwinter; then it had turned warm again, and some kind of a rash had\r\nbroken out on the child.",
        "The doctor had said she must bathe him every\r\nnight, and she, foolish woman, believed him.",
        "Jurgis scarcely heard the explanation; he was watching the baby.",
        "He was\r\nabout a year old, and a sturdy little fellow, with soft fat legs, and a\r\nround ball of a stomach, and eyes as black as coals.",
        "His pimples did\r\nnot seem to bother him much, and he was wild with glee over the bath,\r\nkicking and squirming and chuckling with delight, pulling at his\r\nmother’s face and then at his own little toes.",
        "When she put him into\r\nthe basin he sat in the midst of it and grinned, splashing the water\r\nover himself and squealing like a little pig.",
        "He spoke in Russian, of\r\nwhich Jurgis knew some; he spoke it with the quaintest of baby\r\naccents—and every word of it brought back to Jurgis some word of his\r\nown dead little one, and stabbed him like a knife.",
        "He sat perfectly\r\nmotionless, silent, but gripping his hands tightly, while a storm\r\ngathered in his bosom and a flood heaped itself up behind his eyes.",
        "And\r\nin the end he could bear it no more, but buried his face in his hands\r\nand burst into tears, to the alarm and amazement of his hosts.",
        "Between\r\nthe shame of this and his woe Jurgis could not stand it, and got up and\r\nrushed out into the rain.",
        "He went on and on down the road, finally coming to a black woods, where\r\nhe hid and wept as if his heart would break.",
        "Ah, what agony was that,\r\nwhat despair, when the tomb of memory was rent open and the ghosts of\r\nhis old life came forth to scourge him!",
        "What terror to see what he had\r\nbeen and now could never be—to see Ona and his child and his own dead\r\nself stretching out their arms to him, calling to him across a\r\nbottomless abyss—and to know that they were gone from him forever, and\r\nhe writhing and suffocating in the mire of his own vileness!",
        "CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the fall Jurgis set out for Chicago again.",
        "All the joy went\r\nout of tramping as soon as a man could not keep warm in the hay; and,\r\nlike many thousands of others, he deluded himself with the hope that by\r\ncoming early he could avoid the rush.",
        "He brought fifteen dollars with\r\nhim, hidden away in one of his shoes, a sum which had been saved from\r\nthe saloon-keepers, not so much by his conscience, as by the fear which\r\nfilled him at the thought of being out of work in the city in the\r\nwinter time.",
        "He traveled upon the railroad with several other men, hiding in freight\r\ncars at night, and liable to be thrown off at any time, regardless of\r\nthe speed of the train.",
        "When he reached the city he left the rest, for\r\nhe had money and they did not, and he meant to save himself in this\r\nfight.",
        "He would bring to it all the skill that practice had brought\r\nhim, and he would stand, whoever fell.",
        "On fair nights he would sleep in\r\nthe park or on a truck or an empty barrel or box, and when it was rainy\r\nor cold he would stow himself upon a shelf in a ten-cent lodging-house,\r\nor pay three cents for the privileges of a “squatter” in a tenement\r\nhallway.",
        "He would eat at free lunches, five cents a meal, and never a\r\ncent more—so he might keep alive for two months and more, and in that\r\ntime he would surely find a job.",
        "He would have to bid farewell to his\r\nsummer cleanliness, of course, for he would come out of the first\r\nnight’s lodging with his clothes alive with vermin.",
        "There was no place\r\nin the city where he could wash even his face, unless he went down to\r\nthe lake front—and there it would soon be all ice.",
        "First he went to the steel mill and the harvester works, and found that\r\nhis places there had been filled long ago.",
        "He was careful to keep away\r\nfrom the stockyards—he was a single man now, he told himself, and he\r\nmeant to stay one, to have his wages for his own when he got a job.",
        "He\r\nbegan the long, weary round of factories and warehouses, tramping all\r\nday, from one end of the city to the other, finding everywhere from ten\r\nto a hundred men ahead of him.",
        "He watched the newspapers, too—but no\r\nlonger was he to be taken in by smooth-spoken agents.",
        "He had been told\r\nof all those tricks while “on the road.”\r\n\r\nIn the end it was through a newspaper that he got a job, after nearly a\r\nmonth of seeking.",
        "It was a call for a hundred laborers, and though he\r\nthought it was a “fake,” he went because the place was near by.",
        "He\r\nfound a line of men a block long, but as a wagon chanced to come out of\r\nan alley and break the line, he saw his chance and sprang to seize a\r\nplace.",
        "Men threatened him and tried to throw him out, but he cursed and\r\nmade a disturbance to attract a policeman, upon which they subsided,\r\nknowing that if the latter interfered it would be to “fire” them all.",
        "An hour or two later he entered a room and confronted a big Irishman\r\nbehind a desk.",
        "“Ever worked in Chicago before?” the man inquired; and whether it was a\r\ngood angel that put it into Jurgis’s mind, or an intuition of his\r\nsharpened wits, he was moved to answer, “No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you come from?”\r\n\r\n“Kansas City, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Any references?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.",
        "I’m just an unskilled man.",
        "I’ve got good arms.”\r\n\r\n“I want men for hard work—it’s all underground, digging tunnels for\r\ntelephones.",
        "Maybe it won’t suit you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m willing, sir—anything for me.",
        "What’s the pay?”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen cents an hour.”\r\n\r\n“I’m willing, sir.”\r\n\r\n“All right; go back there and give your name.”\r\n\r\nSo within half an hour he was at work, far underneath the streets of\r\nthe city.",
        "The tunnel was a peculiar one for telephone wires; it was\r\nabout eight feet high, and with a level floor nearly as wide.",
        "It had\r\ninnumerable branches—a perfect spider web beneath the city; Jurgis\r\nwalked over half a mile with his gang to the place where they were to\r\nwork.",
        "Stranger yet, the tunnel was lighted by electricity, and upon it\r\nwas laid a double-tracked, narrow-gauge railroad!",
        "But Jurgis was not there to ask questions, and he did not give the\r\nmatter a thought.",
        "It was nearly a year afterward that he finally\r\nlearned the meaning of this whole affair.",
        "The City Council had passed a\r\nquiet and innocent little bill allowing a company to construct\r\ntelephone conduits under the city streets; and upon the strength of\r\nthis, a great corporation had proceeded to tunnel all Chicago with a\r\nsystem of railway freight-subways.",
        "In the city there was a combination\r\nof employers, representing hundreds of millions of capital, and formed\r\nfor the purpose of crushing the labor unions.",
        "The chief union which\r\ntroubled it was the teamsters’; and when these freight tunnels were\r\ncompleted, connecting all the big factories and stores with the\r\nrailroad depots, they would have the teamsters’ union by the throat.",
        "Now and then there were rumors and murmurs in the Board of Aldermen,\r\nand once there was a committee to investigate—but each time another\r\nsmall fortune was paid over, and the rumors died away; until at last\r\nthe city woke up with a start to find the work completed.",
        "There was a\r\ntremendous scandal, of course; it was found that the city records had\r\nbeen falsified and other crimes committed, and some of Chicago’s big\r\ncapitalists got into jail—figuratively speaking.",
        "The aldermen declared\r\nthat they had had no idea of it all, in spite of the fact that the main\r\nentrance to the work had been in the rear of the saloon of one of them.",
        "It was in a newly opened cut that Jurgis worked, and so he knew that he\r\nhad an all-winter job.",
        "He was so rejoiced that he treated himself to a\r\nspree that night, and with the balance of his money he hired himself a\r\nplace in a tenement room, where he slept upon a big homemade straw\r\nmattress along with four other workingmen.",
        "This was one dollar a week,\r\nand for four more he got his food in a boardinghouse near his work.",
        "This would leave him four dollars extra each week, an unthinkable sum\r\nfor him.",
        "At the outset he had to pay for his digging tools, and also to\r\nbuy a pair of heavy boots, since his shoes were falling to pieces, and\r\na flannel shirt, since the one he had worn all summer was in shreds.",
        "He\r\nspent a week meditating whether or not he should also buy an overcoat.",
        "There was one belonging to a Hebrew collar button peddler, who had died\r\nin the room next to him, and which the landlady was holding for her\r\nrent; in the end, however, Jurgis decided to do without it, as he was\r\nto be underground by day and in bed at night.",
        "This was an unfortunate decision, however, for it drove him more\r\nquickly than ever into the saloons.",
        "From now on Jurgis worked from\r\nseven o’clock until half-past five, with half an hour for dinner; which\r\nmeant that he never saw the sunlight on weekdays.",
        "In the evenings there\r\nwas no place for him to go except a barroom; no place where there was\r\nlight and warmth, where he could hear a little music or sit with a\r\ncompanion and talk.",
        "He had now no home to go to; he had no affection\r\nleft in his life—only the pitiful mockery of it in the _camaraderie_ of\r\nvice.",
        "On Sundays the churches were open—but where was there a church in\r\nwhich an ill-smelling workingman, with vermin crawling upon his neck,\r\ncould sit without seeing people edge away and look annoyed?",
        "He had, of\r\ncourse, his corner in a close though unheated room, with a window\r\nopening upon a blank wall two feet away; and also he had the bare\r\nstreets, with the winter gales sweeping through them; besides this he\r\nhad only the saloons—and, of course, he had to drink to stay in them.",
        "If he drank now and then he was free to make himself at home, to gamble\r\nwith dice or a pack of greasy cards, to play at a dingy pool table for\r\nmoney, or to look at a beer-stained pink “sporting paper,” with\r\npictures of murderers and half-naked women.",
        "It was for such pleasures\r\nas these that he spent his money; and such was his life during the six\r\nweeks and a half that he toiled for the merchants of Chicago, to enable\r\nthem to break the grip of their teamsters’ union.",
        "In a work thus carried out, not much thought was given to the welfare\r\nof the laborers.",
        "On an average, the tunneling cost a life a day and\r\nseveral manglings; it was seldom, however, that more than a dozen or\r\ntwo men heard of any one accident.",
        "The work was all done by the new\r\nboring machinery, with as little blasting as possible; but there would\r\nbe falling rocks and crushed supports, and premature explosions—and in\r\naddition all the dangers of railroading.",
        "So it was that one night, as\r\nJurgis was on his way out with his gang, an engine and a loaded car\r\ndashed round one of the innumerable right-angle branches and struck him\r\nupon the shoulder, hurling him against the concrete wall and knocking\r\nhim senseless.",
        "When he opened his eyes again it was to the clanging of the bell of an\r\nambulance.",
        "He was lying in it, covered by a blanket, and it was\r\nthreading its way slowly through the holiday-shopping crowds.",
        "They took\r\nhim to the county hospital, where a young surgeon set his arm; then he\r\nwas washed and laid upon a bed in a ward with a score or two more of\r\nmaimed and mangled men.",
        "Jurgis spent his Christmas in this hospital, and it was the pleasantest\r\nChristmas he had had in America.",
        "Every year there were scandals and\r\ninvestigations in this institution, the newspapers charging that\r\ndoctors were allowed to try fantastic experiments upon the patients;\r\nbut Jurgis knew nothing of this—his only complaint was that they used\r\nto feed him upon tinned meat, which no man who had ever worked in\r\nPackingtown would feed to his dog.",
        "Jurgis had often wondered just who\r\nate the canned corned beef and “roast beef” of the stockyards; now he\r\nbegan to understand—that it was what you might call “graft meat,” put\r\nup to be sold to public officials and contractors, and eaten by\r\nsoldiers and sailors, prisoners and inmates of institutions,\r\n“shantymen” and gangs of railroad laborers.",
        "Jurgis was ready to leave the hospital at the end of two weeks.",
        "This\r\ndid not mean that his arm was strong and that he was able to go back to\r\nwork, but simply that he could get along without further attention, and\r\nthat his place was needed for some one worse off than he.",
        "That he was\r\nutterly helpless, and had no means of keeping himself alive in the\r\nmeantime, was something which did not concern the hospital authorities,\r\nnor any one else in the city.",
        "As it chanced, he had been hurt on a Monday, and had just paid for his\r\nlast week’s board and his room rent, and spent nearly all the balance\r\nof his Saturday’s pay.",
        "He had less than seventy-five cents in his\r\npockets, and a dollar and a half due him for the day’s work he had done\r\nbefore he was hurt.",
        "He might possibly have sued the company, and got\r\nsome damages for his injuries, but he did not know this, and it was not\r\nthe company’s business to tell him.",
        "He went and got his pay and his\r\ntools, which he left in a pawnshop for fifty cents.",
        "Then he went to his\r\nlandlady, who had rented his place and had no other for him; and then\r\nto his boardinghouse keeper, who looked him over and questioned him.",
        "As\r\nhe must certainly be helpless for a couple of months, and had boarded\r\nthere only six weeks, she decided very quickly that it would not be\r\nworth the risk to keep him on trust.",
        "So Jurgis went out into the streets, in a most dreadful plight.",
        "It was\r\nbitterly cold, and a heavy snow was falling, beating into his face.",
        "He\r\nhad no overcoat, and no place to go, and two dollars and sixty-five\r\ncents in his pocket, with the certainty that he could not earn another\r\ncent for months.",
        "The snow meant no chance to him now; he must walk\r\nalong and see others shoveling, vigorous and active—and he with his\r\nleft arm bound to his side!",
        "He could not hope to tide himself over by\r\nodd jobs of loading trucks; he could not even sell newspapers or carry\r\nsatchels, because he was now at the mercy of any rival.",
        "Words could not\r\npaint the terror that came over him as he realized all this.",
        "He was\r\nlike a wounded animal in the forest; he was forced to compete with his\r\nenemies upon unequal terms.",
        "There would be no consideration for him\r\nbecause of his weakness—it was no one’s business to help him in such\r\ndistress, to make the fight the least bit easier for him.",
        "Even if he\r\ntook to begging, he would be at a disadvantage, for reasons which he\r\nwas to discover in good time.",
        "In the beginning he could not think of anything except getting out of\r\nthe awful cold.",
        "He went into one of the saloons he had been wont to\r\nfrequent and bought a drink, and then stood by the fire shivering and\r\nwaiting to be ordered out.",
        "According to an unwritten law, the buying a\r\ndrink included the privilege of loafing for just so long; then one had\r\nto buy another drink or move on.",
        "That Jurgis was an old customer\r\nentitled him to a somewhat longer stop; but then he had been away two\r\nweeks, and was evidently “on the bum.” He might plead and tell his\r\n“hard luck story,” but that would not help him much; a saloon-keeper\r\nwho was to be moved by such means would soon have his place jammed to\r\nthe doors with “hoboes” on a day like this.",
        "So Jurgis went out into another place, and paid another nickel.",
        "He was\r\nso hungry this time that he could not resist the hot beef stew, an\r\nindulgence which cut short his stay by a considerable time.",
        "When he was\r\nagain told to move on, he made his way to a “tough” place in the\r\n“Lêvée” district, where now and then he had gone with a certain\r\nrat-eyed Bohemian workingman of his acquaintance, seeking a woman.",
        "It\r\nwas Jurgis’s vain hope that here the proprietor would let him remain as\r\na “sitter.” In low-class places, in the dead of winter, saloon-keepers\r\nwould often allow one or two forlorn-looking bums who came in covered\r\nwith snow or soaked with rain to sit by the fire and look miserable to\r\nattract custom.",
        "A workingman would come in, feeling cheerful after his\r\nday’s work was over, and it would trouble him to have to take his glass\r\nwith such a sight under his nose; and so he would call out: “Hello,\r\nBub, what’s the matter?",
        "You look as if you’d been up against it!” And\r\nthen the other would begin to pour out some tale of misery, and the man\r\nwould say, “Come have a glass, and maybe that’ll brace you up.” And so\r\nthey would drink together, and if the tramp was sufficiently\r\nwretched-looking, or good enough at the “gab,” they might have two; and\r\nif they were to discover that they were from the same country, or had\r\nlived in the same city or worked at the same trade, they might sit down\r\nat a table and spend an hour or two in talk—and before they got through\r\nthe saloon-keeper would have taken in a dollar.",
        "All of this might seem\r\ndiabolical, but the saloon-keeper was in no wise to blame for it.",
        "He\r\nwas in the same plight as the manufacturer who has to adulterate and\r\nmisrepresent his product.",
        "If he does not, some one else will; and the\r\nsaloon-keeper, unless he is also an alderman, is apt to be in debt to\r\nthe big brewers, and on the verge of being sold out.",
        "The market for “sitters” was glutted that afternoon, however, and there\r\nwas no place for Jurgis.",
        "In all he had to spend six nickels in keeping\r\na shelter over him that frightful day, and then it was just dark, and\r\nthe station houses would not open until midnight!",
        "At the last place,\r\nhowever, there was a bartender who knew him and liked him, and let him\r\ndoze at one of the tables until the boss came back; and also, as he was\r\ngoing out, the man gave him a tip—on the next block there was a\r\nreligious revival of some sort, with preaching and singing, and\r\nhundreds of hoboes would go there for the shelter and warmth.",
        "Jurgis went straightway, and saw a sign hung out, saying that the door\r\nwould open at seven-thirty; then he walked, or half ran, a block, and\r\nhid awhile in a doorway and then ran again, and so on until the hour.",
        "At the end he was all but frozen, and fought his way in with the rest\r\nof the throng (at the risk of having his arm broken again), and got\r\nclose to the big stove.",
        "By eight o’clock the place was so crowded that the speakers ought to\r\nhave been flattered; the aisles were filled halfway up, and at the door\r\nmen were packed tight enough to walk upon.",
        "There were three elderly\r\ngentlemen in black upon the platform, and a young lady who played the\r\npiano in front.",
        "First they sang a hymn, and then one of the three, a\r\ntall, smooth-shaven man, very thin, and wearing black spectacles, began\r\nan address.",
        "Jurgis heard smatterings of it, for the reason that terror\r\nkept him awake—he knew that he snored abominably, and to have been put\r\nout just then would have been like a sentence of death to him.",
        "The evangelist was preaching “sin and redemption,” the infinite grace\r\nof God and His pardon for human frailty.",
        "He was very much in earnest,\r\nand he meant well, but Jurgis, as he listened, found his soul filled\r\nwith hatred.",
        "What did he know about sin and suffering—with his smooth,\r\nblack coat and his neatly starched collar, his body warm, and his belly\r\nfull, and money in his pocket—and lecturing men who were struggling for\r\ntheir lives, men at the death grapple with the demon powers of hunger\r\nand cold!—This, of course, was unfair; but Jurgis felt that these men\r\nwere out of touch with the life they discussed, that they were unfitted\r\nto solve its problems; nay, they themselves were part of the\r\nproblem—they were part of the order established that was crushing men\r\ndown and beating them!",
        "They were of the triumphant and insolent\r\npossessors; they had a hall, and a fire, and food and clothing and\r\nmoney, and so they might preach to hungry men, and the hungry men must\r\nbe humble and listen!",
        "They were trying to save their souls—and who but\r\na fool could fail to see that all that was the matter with their souls\r\nwas that they had not been able to get a decent existence for their\r\nbodies?",
        "At eleven the meeting closed, and the desolate audience filed out into\r\nthe snow, muttering curses upon the few traitors who had got repentance\r\nand gone up on the platform.",
        "It was yet an hour before the station\r\nhouse would open, and Jurgis had no overcoat—and was weak from a long\r\nillness.",
        "During that hour he nearly perished.",
        "He was obliged to run\r\nhard to keep his blood moving at all—and then he came back to the\r\nstation house and found a crowd blocking the street before the door!",
        "This was in the month of January, 1904, when the country was on the\r\nverge of “hard times,” and the newspapers were reporting the shutting\r\ndown of factories every day—it was estimated that a million and a half\r\nmen were thrown out of work before the spring.",
        "So all the hiding places\r\nof the city were crowded, and before that station house door men fought\r\nand tore each other like savage beasts.",
        "When at last the place was\r\njammed and they shut the doors, half the crowd was still outside; and\r\nJurgis, with his helpless arm, was among them.",
        "There was no choice then\r\nbut to go to a lodging-house and spend another dime.",
        "It really broke\r\nhis heart to do this, at half-past twelve o’clock, after he had wasted\r\nthe night at the meeting and on the street.",
        "He would be turned out of\r\nthe lodging-house promptly at seven—they had the shelves which served\r\nas bunks so contrived that they could be dropped, and any man who was\r\nslow about obeying orders could be tumbled to the floor.",
        "This was one day, and the cold spell lasted for fourteen of them.",
        "At\r\nthe end of six days every cent of Jurgis’ money was gone; and then he\r\nwent out on the streets to beg for his life.",
        "He would begin as soon as the business of the city was moving.",
        "He would\r\nsally forth from a saloon, and, after making sure there was no\r\npoliceman in sight, would approach every likely-looking person who\r\npassed him, telling his woeful story and pleading for a nickel or a\r\ndime.",
        "Then when he got one, he would dart round the corner and return\r\nto his base to get warm; and his victim, seeing him do this, would go\r\naway, vowing that he would never give a cent to a beggar again.",
        "The\r\nvictim never paused to ask where else Jurgis could have gone under the\r\ncircumstances—where he, the victim, would have gone.",
        "At the saloon\r\nJurgis could not only get more food and better food than he could buy\r\nin any restaurant for the same money, but a drink in the bargain to\r\nwarm him up.",
        "Also he could find a comfortable seat by a fire, and could\r\nchat with a companion until he was as warm as toast.",
        "At the saloon,\r\ntoo, he felt at home.",
        "Part of the saloon-keeper’s business was to offer\r\na home and refreshments to beggars in exchange for the proceeds of\r\ntheir foragings; and was there any one else in the whole city who would\r\ndo this—would the victim have done it himself?",
        "Poor Jurgis might have been expected to make a successful beggar.",
        "He\r\nwas just out of the hospital, and desperately sick-looking, and with a\r\nhelpless arm; also he had no overcoat, and shivered pitifully.",
        "But,\r\nalas, it was again the case of the honest merchant, who finds that the\r\ngenuine and unadulterated article is driven to the wall by the artistic\r\ncounterfeit.",
        "Jurgis, as a beggar, was simply a blundering amateur in\r\ncompetition with organized and scientific professionalism.",
        "He was just\r\nout of the hospital—but the story was worn threadbare, and how could he\r\nprove it?",
        "He had his arm in a sling—and it was a device a regular\r\nbeggar’s little boy would have scorned.",
        "He was pale and shivering—but\r\nthey were made up with cosmetics, and had studied the art of chattering\r\ntheir teeth.",
        "As to his being without an overcoat, among them you would\r\nmeet men you could swear had on nothing but a ragged linen duster and a\r\npair of cotton trousers—so cleverly had they concealed the several\r\nsuits of all-wool underwear beneath.",
        "Many of these professional\r\nmendicants had comfortable homes, and families, and thousands of\r\ndollars in the bank; some of them had retired upon their earnings, and\r\ngone into the business of fitting out and doctoring others, or working\r\nchildren at the trade.",
        "There were some who had both their arms bound\r\ntightly to their sides, and padded stumps in their sleeves, and a sick\r\nchild hired to carry a cup for them.",
        "There were some who had no legs,\r\nand pushed themselves upon a wheeled platform—some who had been favored\r\nwith blindness, and were led by pretty little dogs.",
        "Some less fortunate\r\nhad mutilated themselves or burned themselves, or had brought horrible\r\nsores upon themselves with chemicals; you might suddenly encounter upon\r\nthe street a man holding out to you a finger rotting and discolored\r\nwith gangrene—or one with livid scarlet wounds half escaped from their\r\nfilthy bandages.",
        "These desperate ones were the dregs of the city’s\r\ncesspools, wretches who hid at night in the rain-soaked cellars of old\r\nramshackle tenements, in “stale-beer dives” and opium joints, with\r\nabandoned women in the last stages of the harlot’s progress—women who\r\nhad been kept by Chinamen and turned away at last to die.",
        "Every day the\r\npolice net would drag hundreds of them off the streets, and in the\r\ndetention hospital you might see them, herded together in a miniature\r\ninferno, with hideous, beastly faces, bloated and leprous with disease,\r\nlaughing, shouting, screaming in all stages of drunkenness, barking\r\nlike dogs, gibbering like apes, raving and tearing themselves in\r\ndelirium.",
        "CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the face of all his handicaps, Jurgis was obliged to make the price\r\nof a lodging, and of a drink every hour or two, under penalty of\r\nfreezing to death.",
        "Day after day he roamed about in the arctic cold,\r\nhis soul filled full of bitterness and despair.",
        "He saw the world of\r\ncivilization then more plainly than ever he had seen it before; a world\r\nin which nothing counted but brutal might, an order devised by those\r\nwho possessed it for the subjugation of those who did not.",
        "He was one\r\nof the latter; and all outdoors, all life, was to him one colossal\r\nprison, which he paced like a pent-up tiger, trying one bar after\r\nanother, and finding them all beyond his power.",
        "He had lost in the\r\nfierce battle of greed, and so was doomed to be exterminated; and all\r\nsociety was busied to see that he did not escape the sentence.",
        "Everywhere that he turned were prison bars, and hostile eyes following\r\nhim; the well-fed, sleek policemen, from whose glances he shrank, and\r\nwho seemed to grip their clubs more tightly when they saw him; the\r\nsaloon-keepers, who never ceased to watch him while he was in their\r\nplaces, who were jealous of every moment he lingered after he had paid\r\nhis money; the hurrying throngs upon the streets, who were deaf to his\r\nentreaties, oblivious of his very existence—and savage and contemptuous\r\nwhen he forced himself upon them.",
        "They had their own affairs, and there\r\nwas no place for him among them.",
        "There was no place for him\r\nanywhere—every direction he turned his gaze, this fact was forced upon\r\nhim: Everything was built to express it to him: the residences, with\r\ntheir heavy walls and bolted doors, and basement windows barred with\r\niron; the great warehouses filled with the products of the whole world,\r\nand guarded by iron shutters and heavy gates; the banks with their\r\nunthinkable billions of wealth, all buried in safes and vaults of\r\nsteel.",
        "And then one day there befell Jurgis the one adventure of his life.",
        "It\r\nwas late at night, and he had failed to get the price of a lodging.",
        "Snow was falling, and he had been out so long that he was covered with\r\nit, and was chilled to the bone.",
        "He was working among the theater\r\ncrowds, flitting here and there, taking large chances with the police,\r\nin his desperation half hoping to be arrested.",
        "When he saw a blue-coat\r\nstart toward him, however, his heart failed him, and he dashed down a\r\nside street and fled a couple of blocks.",
        "When he stopped again he saw a\r\nman coming toward him, and placed himself in his path.",
        "“Please, sir,” he began, in the usual formula, “will you give me the\r\nprice of a lodging?",
        "I’ve had a broken arm, and I can’t work, and I’ve\r\nnot a cent in my pocket.",
        "I’m an honest working-man, sir, and I never\r\nbegged before!",
        "It’s not my fault, sir—”\r\n\r\nJurgis usually went on until he was interrupted, but this man did not\r\ninterrupt, and so at last he came to a breathless stop.",
        "The other had\r\nhalted, and Jurgis suddenly noticed that he stood a little unsteadily.",
        "“Whuzzat you say?” he queried suddenly, in a thick voice.",
        "Jurgis began again, speaking more slowly and distinctly; before he was\r\nhalf through the other put out his hand and rested it upon his\r\nshoulder.",
        "“Poor ole chappie!” he said.",
        "“Been up—hic—up—against it,\r\nhey?”\r\n\r\nThen he lurched toward Jurgis, and the hand upon his shoulder became an\r\narm about his neck.",
        "“Up against it myself, ole sport,” he said.",
        "“She’s\r\na hard ole world.”\r\n\r\nThey were close to a lamppost, and Jurgis got a glimpse of the other.",
        "He was a young fellow—not much over eighteen, with a handsome boyish\r\nface.",
        "He wore a silk hat and a rich soft overcoat with a fur collar;\r\nand he smiled at Jurgis with benignant sympathy.",
        "“I’m hard up, too, my\r\ngoo’ fren’,” he said.",
        "“I’ve got cruel parents, or I’d set you up.",
        "Whuzzamatter whizyer?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in the hospital.”\r\n\r\n“Hospital!” exclaimed the young fellow, still smiling sweetly, “thass\r\ntoo bad!",
        "Same’s my Aunt Polly—hic—my Aunt Polly’s in the hospital,\r\ntoo—ole auntie’s been havin’ twins!",
        "Whuzzamatter whiz you?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a broken arm—” Jurgis began.",
        "“So,” said the other, sympathetically.",
        "“That ain’t so bad—you get over\r\nthat.",
        "I wish somebody’d break _my_ arm, ole chappie—damfidon’t!",
        "Then\r\nthey’d treat me better—hic—hole me up, ole sport!",
        "Whuzzit you wamme\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\n“I’m hungry, sir,” said Jurgis.",
        "“Hungry!",
        "Why don’t you hassome supper?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got no money, sir.”\r\n\r\n“No money!",
        "Ho, ho—less be chums, ole boy—jess like me!",
        "No money,\r\neither—a’most busted!",
        "Why don’t you go home, then, same’s me?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t any home,” said Jurgis.",
        "“No home!",
        "Stranger in the city, hey?",
        "Goo’ God, thass bad!",
        "Better come\r\nhome wiz me—yes, by Harry, thass the trick, you’ll come home an’\r\nhassome supper—hic—wiz me!",
        "Awful lonesome—nobody home!",
        "Guv’ner gone\r\nabroad—Bubby on’s honeymoon—Polly havin’ twins—every damn soul gone\r\naway!",
        "Nuff—hic—nuff to drive a feller to drink, I say!",
        "Only ole Ham\r\nstandin’ by, passin’ plates—damfican eat like that, no sir!",
        "The club\r\nfor me every time, my boy, I say.",
        "But then they won’t lemme sleep\r\nthere—guv’ner’s orders, by Harry—home every night, sir!",
        "Ever hear\r\nanythin’ like that?",
        "‘Every mornin’ do?’ I asked him.",
        "‘No, sir, every\r\nnight, or no allowance at all, sir.’ Thass my guv’ner—‘nice as nails,\r\nby Harry!",
        "Tole ole Ham to watch me, too—servants spyin’ on me—whuzyer\r\nthink that, my fren’?",
        "A nice, quiet—hic—goodhearted young feller like\r\nme, an’ his daddy can’t go to Europe—hup!—an’ leave him in peace!",
        "Ain’t\r\nthat a shame, sir?",
        "An’ I gotter go home every evenin’ an’ miss all the\r\nfun, by Harry!",
        "Thass whuzzamatter now—thass why I’m here!",
        "Hadda come\r\naway an’ leave Kitty—hic—left her cryin’, too—whujja think of that, ole\r\nsport?",
        "‘Lemme go, Kittens,’ says I—‘come early an’ often—I go where\r\nduty—hic—calls me.",
        "Farewell, farewell, my own true love—farewell,\r\nfarewehell, my—own true—love!’”\r\n\r\nThis last was a song, and the young gentleman’s voice rose mournful and\r\nwailing, while he swung upon Jurgis’s neck.",
        "The latter was glancing\r\nabout nervously, lest some one should approach.",
        "They were still alone,\r\nhowever.",
        "“But I came all right, all right,” continued the youngster,\r\naggressively, “I can—hic—I can have my own way when I want it, by\r\nHarry—Freddie Jones is a hard man to handle when he gets goin’!",
        "‘No,\r\nsir,’ says I, ‘by thunder, and I don’t need anybody goin’ home with me,\r\neither—whujja take me for, hey?",
        "Think I’m drunk, dontcha, hey?—I know\r\nyou!",
        "But I’m no more drunk than you are, Kittens,’ says I to her.",
        "And\r\nthen says she, ‘Thass true, Freddie dear’ (she’s a smart one, is\r\nKitty), ‘but I’m stayin’ in the flat, an’ you’re goin’ out into the\r\ncold, cold night!’ ‘Put it in a pome, lovely Kitty,’ says I.",
        "‘No\r\njokin’, Freddie, my boy,’ says she.",
        "‘Lemme call a cab now, like a good\r\ndear’—but I can call my own cabs, dontcha fool yourself—and I know what\r\nI’m a-doin’, you bet!",
        "Say, my fren’, whatcha say—willye come home an’\r\nsee me, an’ hassome supper?",
        "Come ’long like a good feller—don’t be\r\nhaughty!",
        "You’re up against it, same as me, an’ you can unerstan’ a\r\nfeller; your heart’s in the right place, by Harry—come ’long, ole\r\nchappie, an’ we’ll light up the house, an’ have some fizz, an’ we’ll\r\nraise hell, we will—whoop-la!",
        "S’long’s I’m inside the house I can do as\r\nI please—the guv’ner’s own very orders, b’God!",
        "Hip!",
        "hip!”\r\n\r\nThey had started down the street, arm in arm, the young man pushing\r\nJurgis along, half dazed.",
        "Jurgis was trying to think what to do—he knew\r\nhe could not pass any crowded place with his new acquaintance without\r\nattracting attention and being stopped.",
        "It was only because of the\r\nfalling snow that people who passed here did not notice anything wrong.",
        "Suddenly, therefore, Jurgis stopped.",
        "“Is it very far?” he inquired.",
        "“Not very,” said the other, “Tired, are you, though?",
        "Well, we’ll\r\nride—whatcha say?",
        "Good!",
        "Call a cab!”\r\n\r\nAnd then, gripping Jurgis tight with one hand, the young fellow began\r\nsearching his pockets with the other.",
        "“You call, ole sport, an’ I’ll\r\npay,” he suggested.",
        "“How’s that, hey?”\r\n\r\nAnd he pulled out from somewhere a big roll of bills.",
        "It was more money\r\nthan Jurgis had ever seen in his life before, and he stared at it with\r\nstartled eyes.",
        "“Looks like a lot, hey?” said Master Freddie, fumbling with it.",
        "“Fool\r\nyou, though, ole chappie—they’re all little ones!",
        "I’ll be busted in one\r\nweek more, sure thing—word of honor.",
        "An’ not a cent more till the\r\nfirst—hic—guv’ner’s orders—hic—not a _cent_, by Harry!",
        "Nuff to set a\r\nfeller crazy, it is.",
        "I sent him a cable, this af’noon—thass one reason\r\nmore why I’m goin’ home.",
        "‘Hangin’ on the verge of starvation,’ I\r\nsays—‘for the honor of the family—hic—sen’ me some bread.",
        "Hunger will\r\ncompel me to join you—Freddie.’ Thass what I wired him, by Harry, an’ I\r\nmean it—I’ll run away from school, b’God, if he don’t sen’ me some.”\r\n\r\nAfter this fashion the young gentleman continued to prattle on—and\r\nmeantime Jurgis was trembling with excitement.",
        "He might grab that wad\r\nof bills and be out of sight in the darkness before the other could\r\ncollect his wits.",
        "Should he do it?",
        "What better had he to hope for, if\r\nhe waited longer?",
        "But Jurgis had never committed a crime in his life,\r\nand now he hesitated half a second too long.",
        "“Freddie” got one bill\r\nloose, and then stuffed the rest back into his trousers’ pocket.",
        "“Here, ole man,” he said, “you take it.” He held it out fluttering.",
        "They were in front of a saloon; and by the light of the window Jurgis\r\nsaw that it was a hundred-dollar bill!",
        "“You take it,” the other\r\nrepeated.",
        "“Pay the cabbie an’ keep the change—I’ve got—hic—no head for\r\nbusiness!",
        "Guv’ner says so hisself, an’ the guv’ner knows—the guv’ner’s\r\ngot a head for business, you bet!",
        "‘All right, guv’ner,’ I told him,\r\n‘you run the show, and I’ll take the tickets!’ An’ so he set Aunt Polly\r\nto watch me—hic—an’ now Polly’s off in the hospital havin’ twins, an’\r\nme out raisin’ Cain!",
        "Hello, there!",
        "Hey!",
        "Call him!”\r\n\r\nA cab was driving by; and Jurgis sprang and called, and it swung round\r\nto the curb.",
        "Master Freddie clambered in with some difficulty, and\r\nJurgis had started to follow, when the driver shouted: “Hi, there!",
        "Get\r\nout—you!”\r\n\r\nJurgis hesitated, and was half obeying; but his companion broke out:\r\n“Whuzzat?",
        "Whuzzamatter wiz you, hey?”\r\n\r\nAnd the cabbie subsided, and Jurgis climbed in.",
        "Then Freddie gave a\r\nnumber on the Lake Shore Drive, and the carriage started away.",
        "The\r\nyoungster leaned back and snuggled up to Jurgis, murmuring contentedly;\r\nin half a minute he was sound asleep, Jurgis sat shivering, speculating\r\nas to whether he might not still be able to get hold of the roll of\r\nbills.",
        "He was afraid to try to go through his companion’s pockets,\r\nhowever; and besides the cabbie might be on the watch.",
        "He had the\r\nhundred safe, and he would have to be content with that.",
        "At the end of half an hour or so the cab stopped.",
        "They were out on the\r\nwaterfront, and from the east a freezing gale was blowing off the\r\nice-bound lake.",
        "“Here we are,” called the cabbie, and Jurgis awakened\r\nhis companion.",
        "Master Freddie sat up with a start.",
        "“Hello!” he said.",
        "“Where are we?",
        "Whuzzis?",
        "Who are you, hey?",
        "Oh, yes,\r\nsure nuff!",
        "Mos’ forgot you—hic—ole chappie!",
        "Home, are we?",
        "Lessee!",
        "Br-r-r—it’s cold!",
        "Yes—come ’long—we’re home—it ever so—hic—humble!”\r\n\r\nBefore them there loomed an enormous granite pile, set far back from\r\nthe street, and occupying a whole block.",
        "By the light of the driveway\r\nlamps Jurgis could see that it had towers and huge gables, like a\r\nmediæval castle.",
        "He thought that the young fellow must have made a\r\nmistake—it was inconceivable to him that any person could have a home\r\nlike a hotel or the city hall.",
        "But he followed in silence, and they\r\nwent up the long flight of steps, arm in arm.",
        "“There’s a button here, ole sport,” said Master Freddie.",
        "“Hole my arm\r\nwhile I find her!",
        "Steady, now—oh, yes, here she is!",
        "Saved!”\r\n\r\nA bell rang, and in a few seconds the door was opened.",
        "A man in blue\r\nlivery stood holding it, and gazing before him, silent as a statue.",
        "They stood for a moment blinking in the light.",
        "Then Jurgis felt his\r\ncompanion pulling, and he stepped in, and the blue automaton closed the\r\ndoor.",
        "Jurgis’s heart was beating wildly; it was a bold thing for him to\r\ndo—into what strange unearthly place he was venturing he had no idea.",
        "Aladdin entering his cave could not have been more excited.",
        "The place where he stood was dimly lighted; but he could see a vast\r\nhall, with pillars fading into the darkness above, and a great\r\nstaircase opening at the far end of it.",
        "The floor was of tesselated\r\nmarble, smooth as glass, and from the walls strange shapes loomed out,\r\nwoven into huge portieres in rich, harmonious colors, or gleaming from\r\npaintings, wonderful and mysterious-looking in the half-light, purple\r\nand red and golden, like sunset glimmers in a shadowy forest.",
        "The man in livery had moved silently toward them; Master Freddie took\r\noff his hat and handed it to him, and then, letting go of Jurgis’ arm,\r\ntried to get out of his overcoat.",
        "After two or three attempts he\r\naccomplished this, with the lackey’s help, and meantime a second man\r\nhad approached, a tall and portly personage, solemn as an executioner.",
        "He bore straight down upon Jurgis, who shrank away nervously; he seized\r\nhim by the arm without a word, and started toward the door with him.",
        "Then suddenly came Master Freddie’s voice, “Hamilton!",
        "My fren’ will\r\nremain wiz me.”\r\n\r\nThe man paused and half released Jurgis.",
        "“Come ’long ole chappie,” said\r\nthe other, and Jurgis started toward him.",
        "“Master Frederick!” exclaimed the man.",
        "“See that the cabbie—hic—is paid,” was the other’s response; and he\r\nlinked his arm in Jurgis’.",
        "Jurgis was about to say, “I have the money\r\nfor him,” but he restrained himself.",
        "The stout man in uniform signaled\r\nto the other, who went out to the cab, while he followed Jurgis and his\r\nyoung master.",
        "They went down the great hall, and then turned.",
        "Before them were two\r\nhuge doors.",
        "“Hamilton,” said Master Freddie.",
        "“Well, sir?” said the other.",
        "“Whuzzamatter wizze dinin’-room doors?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is the matter, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then why dontcha openum?”\r\n\r\nThe man rolled them back; another vista lost itself in the darkness.",
        "“Lights,” commanded Master Freddie; and the butler pressed a button,\r\nand a flood of brilliant incandescence streamed from above,\r\nhalf-blinding Jurgis.",
        "He stared; and little by little he made out the\r\ngreat apartment, with a domed ceiling from which the light poured, and\r\nwalls that were one enormous painting—nymphs and dryads dancing in a\r\nflower-strewn glade—Diana with her hounds and horses, dashing headlong\r\nthrough a mountain streamlet—a group of maidens bathing in a forest\r\npool—all life-size, and so real that Jurgis thought that it was some\r\nwork of enchantment, that he was in a dream palace.",
        "Then his eye passed\r\nto the long table in the center of the hall, a table black as ebony,\r\nand gleaming with wrought silver and gold.",
        "In the center of it was a\r\nhuge carven bowl, with the glistening gleam of ferns and the red and\r\npurple of rare orchids, glowing from a light hidden somewhere in their\r\nmidst.",
        "“This’s the dinin’ room,” observed Master Freddie.",
        "“How you like it,\r\nhey, ole sport?”\r\n\r\nHe always insisted on having an answer to his remarks, leaning over\r\nJurgis and smiling into his face.",
        "Jurgis liked it.",
        "“Rummy ole place to feed in all ’lone, though,” was Freddie’s\r\ncomment—“rummy’s hell!",
        "Whuzya think, hey?” Then another idea occurred\r\nto him and he went on, without waiting: “Maybe you never saw\r\nanythin—hic—like this ’fore?",
        "Hey, ole chappie?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jurgis.",
        "“Come from country, maybe—hey?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jurgis.",
        "“Aha!",
        "I thosso!",
        "Lossa folks from country never saw such a place.",
        "Guv’ner brings ’em—free show—hic—reg’lar circus!",
        "Go home tell folks\r\nabout it.",
        "Ole man Jones’s place—Jones the packer—beef-trust man.",
        "Made\r\nit all out of hogs, too, damn ole scoundrel.",
        "Now we see where our\r\npennies go—rebates, an’ private car lines—hic—by Harry!",
        "Bully place,\r\nthough—worth seein’!",
        "Ever hear of Jones the packer, hey, ole chappie?”\r\n\r\nJurgis had started involuntarily; the other, whose sharp eyes missed\r\nnothing, demanded: “Whuzzamatter, hey?",
        "Heard of him?”\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis managed to stammer out: “I have worked for him in the\r\nyards.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Master Freddie, with a yell.",
        "“_You!_ In the yards?",
        "Ho,\r\nho!",
        "Why, say, thass good!",
        "Shake hands on it, ole man—by Harry!",
        "Guv’ner\r\nought to be here—glad to see you.",
        "Great fren’s with the men,\r\nguv’ner—labor an’ capital, commun’ty ’f int’rests, an’ all that—hic!",
        "Funny things happen in this world, don’t they, ole man?",
        "Hamilton, lemme\r\ninterduce you—fren’ the family—ole fren’ the guv’ner’s—works in the\r\nyards.",
        "Come to spend the night wiz me, Hamilton—have a hot time.",
        "Me\r\nfren’, Mr.—whuzya name, ole chappie?",
        "Tell us your name.”\r\n\r\n“Rudkus—Jurgis Rudkus.”\r\n\r\n“My fren’, Mr.",
        "Rednose, Hamilton—shake han’s.”\r\n\r\nThe stately butler bowed his head, but made not a sound; and suddenly\r\nMaster Freddie pointed an eager finger at him.",
        "“I know whuzzamatter wiz\r\nyou, Hamilton—lay you a dollar I know!",
        "You think—hic—you think I’m\r\ndrunk!",
        "Hey, now?”\r\n\r\nAnd the butler again bowed his head.",
        "“Yes, sir,” he said, at which\r\nMaster Freddie hung tightly upon Jurgis’s neck and went into a fit of\r\nlaughter.",
        "“Hamilton, you damn ole scoundrel,” he roared, “I’ll ’scharge\r\nyou for impudence, you see ’f I don’t!",
        "Ho, ho, ho!",
        "I’m drunk!",
        "Ho, ho!”\r\n\r\nThe two waited until his fit had spent itself, to see what new whim\r\nwould seize him.",
        "“Whatcha wanta do?” he queried suddenly.",
        "“Wanta see\r\nthe place, ole chappie?",
        "Wamme play the guv’ner—show you roun’?",
        "State\r\nparlors—Looee Cans—Looee Sez—chairs cost three thousand apiece.",
        "Tea\r\nroom Maryanntnet—picture of shepherds dancing—Ruysdael—twenty-three\r\nthousan’!",
        "Ballroom—balc’ny pillars—hic—imported—special\r\nship—sixty-eight thousan’!",
        "Ceilin’ painted in Rome—whuzzat feller’s\r\nname, Hamilton—Mattatoni?",
        "Macaroni?",
        "Then this place—silver\r\nbowl—Benvenuto Cellini—rummy ole Dago!",
        "An’ the organ—thirty thousan’\r\ndollars, sir—starter up, Hamilton, let Mr.",
        "Rednose hear it.",
        "No—never\r\nmind—clean forgot—says he’s hungry, Hamilton—less have some supper.",
        "Only—hic—don’t less have it here—come up to my place, ole sport—nice\r\nan’ cosy.",
        "This way—steady now, don’t slip on the floor.",
        "Hamilton, we’ll\r\nhave a cole spread, an’ some fizz—don’t leave out the fizz, by Harry.",
        "We’ll have some of the eighteen-thirty Madeira.",
        "Hear me, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said the butler, “but, Master Frederick, your father left\r\norders—”\r\n\r\nAnd Master Frederick drew himself up to a stately height.",
        "“My father’s\r\norders were left to me—hic—an’ not to you,” he said.",
        "Then, clasping\r\nJurgis tightly by the neck, he staggered out of the room; on the way\r\nanother idea occurred to him, and he asked: “Any—hic—cable message for\r\nme, Hamilton?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” said the butler.",
        "“Guv’ner must be travelin’.",
        "An’ how’s the twins, Hamilton?”\r\n\r\n“They are doing well, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Master Freddie; and added fervently: “God bless ’em, the\r\nlittle lambs!”\r\n\r\nThey went up the great staircase, one step at a time; at the top of it\r\nthere gleamed at them out of the shadows the figure of a nymph\r\ncrouching by a fountain, a figure ravishingly beautiful, the flesh warm\r\nand glowing with the hues of life.",
        "Above was a huge court, with domed\r\nroof, the various apartments opening into it.",
        "The butler had paused\r\nbelow but a few minutes to give orders, and then followed them; now he\r\npressed a button, and the hall blazed with light.",
        "He opened a door\r\nbefore them, and then pressed another button, as they staggered into\r\nthe apartment.",
        "It was fitted up as a study.",
        "In the center was a mahogany table,\r\ncovered with books, and smokers’ implements; the walls were decorated\r\nwith college trophies and colors—flags, posters, photographs and\r\nknickknacks—tennis rackets, canoe paddles, golf clubs, and polo sticks.",
        "An enormous moose head, with horns six feet across, faced a buffalo\r\nhead on the opposite wall, while bear and tiger skins covered the\r\npolished floor.",
        "There were lounging chairs and sofas, window seats\r\ncovered with soft cushions of fantastic designs; there was one corner\r\nfitted in Persian fashion, with a huge canopy and a jeweled lamp\r\nbeneath.",
        "Beyond, a door opened upon a bedroom, and beyond that was a\r\nswimming pool of the purest marble, that had cost about forty thousand\r\ndollars.",
        "Master Freddie stood for a moment or two, gazing about him; then out of\r\nthe next room a dog emerged, a monstrous bulldog, the most hideous\r\nobject that Jurgis had ever laid eyes upon.",
        "He yawned, opening a mouth\r\nlike a dragon’s; and he came toward the young man, wagging his tail.",
        "“Hello, Dewey!” cried his master.",
        "“Been havin’ a snooze, ole boy?",
        "Well,\r\nwell—hello there, whuzzamatter?” (The dog was snarling at Jurgis.)\r\n“Why, Dewey—this’ my fren’, Mr.",
        "Rednose—ole fren’ the guv’ner’s!",
        "Mr.",
        "Rednose, Admiral Dewey; shake han’s—hic.",
        "Ain’t he a daisy, though—blue\r\nribbon at the New York show—eighty-five hundred at a clip!",
        "How’s that,\r\nhey?”\r\n\r\nThe speaker sank into one of the big armchairs, and Admiral Dewey\r\ncrouched beneath it; he did not snarl again, but he never took his eyes\r\noff Jurgis.",
        "He was perfectly sober, was the Admiral.",
        "The butler had closed the door, and he stood by it, watching Jurgis\r\nevery second.",
        "Now there came footsteps outside, and, as he opened the\r\ndoor a man in livery entered, carrying a folding table, and behind him\r\ntwo men with covered trays.",
        "They stood like statues while the first\r\nspread the table and set out the contents of the trays upon it.",
        "There\r\nwere cold pates, and thin slices of meat, tiny bread and butter\r\nsandwiches with the crust cut off, a bowl of sliced peaches and cream\r\n(in January), little fancy cakes, pink and green and yellow and white,\r\nand half a dozen ice-cold bottles of wine.",
        "“Thass the stuff for you!” cried Master Freddie, exultantly, as he\r\nspied them.",
        "“Come ’long, ole chappie, move up.”\r\n\r\nAnd he seated himself at the table; the waiter pulled a cork, and he\r\ntook the bottle and poured three glasses of its contents in succession\r\ndown his throat.",
        "Then he gave a long-drawn sigh, and cried again to\r\nJurgis to seat himself.",
        "The butler held the chair at the opposite side of the table, and Jurgis\r\nthought it was to keep him out of it; but finally he understand that it\r\nwas the other’s intention to put it under him, and so he sat down,\r\ncautiously and mistrustingly.",
        "Master Freddie perceived that the\r\nattendants embarrassed him, and he remarked with a nod to them, “You\r\nmay go.”\r\n\r\nThey went, all save the butler.",
        "“You may go too, Hamilton,” he said.",
        "“Master Frederick—” the man began.",
        "“Go!” cried the youngster, angrily.",
        "“Damn you, don’t you hear me?”\r\n\r\nThe man went out and closed the door; Jurgis, who was as sharp as he,\r\nobserved that he took the key out of the lock, in order that he might\r\npeer through the keyhole.",
        "Master Frederick turned to the table again.",
        "“Now,” he said, “go for\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nJurgis gazed at him doubtingly.",
        "“Eat!” cried the other.",
        "“Pile in, ole\r\nchappie!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you want anything?” Jurgis asked.",
        "“Ain’t hungry,” was the reply—“only thirsty.",
        "Kitty and me had some\r\ncandy—you go on.”\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis began, without further parley.",
        "He ate as with two shovels,\r\nhis fork in one hand and his knife in the other; when he once got\r\nstarted his wolf-hunger got the better of him, and he did not stop for\r\nbreath until he had cleared every plate.",
        "“Gee whiz!” said the other,\r\nwho had been watching him in wonder.",
        "Then he held Jurgis the bottle.",
        "“Lessee you drink now,” he said; and\r\nJurgis took the bottle and turned it up to his mouth, and a wonderfully\r\nunearthly liquid ecstasy poured down his throat, tickling every nerve\r\nof him, thrilling him with joy.",
        "He drank the very last drop of it, and\r\nthen he gave vent to a long-drawn “Ah!”\r\n\r\n“Good stuff, hey?” said Freddie, sympathetically; he had leaned back in\r\nthe big chair, putting his arm behind his head and gazing at Jurgis.",
        "And Jurgis gazed back at him.",
        "He was clad in spotless evening dress,\r\nwas Freddie, and looked very handsome—he was a beautiful boy, with\r\nlight golden hair and the head of an Antinous.",
        "He smiled at Jurgis\r\nconfidingly, and then started talking again, with his blissful\r\n_insouciance_.",
        "This time he talked for ten minutes at a stretch, and in\r\nthe course of the speech he told Jurgis all of his family history.",
        "His\r\nbig brother Charlie was in love with the guileless maiden who played\r\nthe part of “Little Bright-Eyes” in “The Kaliph of Kamskatka.” He had\r\nbeen on the verge of marrying her once, only “the guv’ner” had sworn to\r\ndisinherit him, and had presented him with a sum that would stagger the\r\nimagination, and that had staggered the virtue of “Little Bright-Eyes.”\r\nNow Charlie had got leave from college, and had gone away in his\r\nautomobile on the next best thing to a honeymoon.",
        "“The guv’ner” had\r\nmade threats to disinherit another of his children also, sister\r\nGwendolen, who had married an Italian marquis with a string of titles\r\nand a dueling record.",
        "They lived in his chateau, or rather had, until\r\nhe had taken to firing the breakfast dishes at her; then she had cabled\r\nfor help, and the old gentleman had gone over to find out what were his\r\nGrace’s terms.",
        "So they had left Freddie all alone, and he with less\r\nthan two thousand dollars in his pocket.",
        "Freddie was up in arms and\r\nmeant serious business, as they would find in the end—if there was no\r\nother way of bringing them to terms he would have his “Kittens” wire\r\nthat she was about to marry him, and see what happened then.",
        "So the cheerful youngster rattled on, until he was tired out.",
        "He smiled\r\nhis sweetest smile at Jurgis, and then he closed his eyes, sleepily.",
        "Then he opened them again, and smiled once more, and finally closed\r\nthem and forgot to open them.",
        "For several minutes Jurgis sat perfectly motionless, watching him, and\r\nreveling in the strange sensation of the champagne.",
        "Once he stirred,\r\nand the dog growled; after that he sat almost holding his breath—until\r\nafter a while the door of the room opened softly, and the butler came\r\nin.",
        "He walked toward Jurgis upon tiptoe, scowling at him; and Jurgis rose\r\nup, and retreated, scowling back.",
        "So until he was against the wall, and\r\nthen the butler came close, and pointed toward the door.",
        "“Get out of\r\nhere!” he whispered.",
        "Jurgis hesitated, giving a glance at Freddie, who was snoring softly.",
        "“If you do, you son of a—” hissed the butler, “I’ll mash in your face\r\nfor you before you get out of here!”\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis wavered but an instant more.",
        "He saw “Admiral Dewey” coming\r\nup behind the man and growling softly, to back up his threats.",
        "Then he\r\nsurrendered and started toward the door.",
        "They went out without a sound, and down the great echoing staircase,\r\nand through the dark hall.",
        "At the front door he paused, and the butler\r\nstrode close to him.",
        "“Hold up your hands,” he snarled.",
        "Jurgis took a step back, clinching\r\nhis one well fist.",
        "“What for?” he cried; and then understanding that the fellow proposed\r\nto search him, he answered, “I’ll see you in hell first.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want to go to jail?” demanded the butler, menacingly.",
        "“I’ll\r\nhave the police—”\r\n\r\n“Have ’em!” roared Jurgis, with fierce passion.",
        "“But you won’t put your\r\nhands on me till you do!",
        "I haven’t touched anything in your damned\r\nhouse, and I’ll not have you touch me!”\r\n\r\nSo the butler, who was terrified lest his young master should waken,\r\nstepped suddenly to the door, and opened it.",
        "“Get out of here!” he\r\nsaid; and then as Jurgis passed through the opening, he gave him a\r\nferocious kick that sent him down the great stone steps at a run, and\r\nlanded him sprawling in the snow at the bottom.",
        "CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis got up, wild with rage, but the door was shut and the great\r\ncastle was dark and impregnable.",
        "Then the icy teeth of the blast bit\r\ninto him, and he turned and went away at a run.",
        "When he stopped again it was because he was coming to frequented\r\nstreets and did not wish to attract attention.",
        "In spite of that last\r\nhumiliation, his heart was thumping fast with triumph.",
        "He had come out\r\nahead on that deal!",
        "He put his hand into his trousers’ pocket every now\r\nand then, to make sure that the precious hundred-dollar bill was still\r\nthere.",
        "Yet he was in a plight—a curious and even dreadful plight, when he came\r\nto realize it.",
        "He had not a single cent but that one bill!",
        "And he had\r\nto find some shelter that night he had to change it!",
        "Jurgis spent half an hour walking and debating the problem.",
        "There was\r\nno one he could go to for help—he had to manage it all alone.",
        "To get it\r\nchanged in a lodging-house would be to take his life in his hands—he\r\nwould almost certainly be robbed, and perhaps murdered, before morning.",
        "He might go to some hotel or railroad depot and ask to have it changed;\r\nbut what would they think, seeing a “bum” like him with a hundred\r\ndollars?",
        "He would probably be arrested if he tried it; and what story\r\ncould he tell?",
        "On the morrow Freddie Jones would discover his loss, and\r\nthere would be a hunt for him, and he would lose his money.",
        "The only\r\nother plan he could think of was to try in a saloon.",
        "He might pay them\r\nto change it, if it could not be done otherwise.",
        "He began peering into places as he walked; he passed several as being\r\ntoo crowded—then finally, chancing upon one where the bartender was all\r\nalone, he gripped his hands in sudden resolution and went in.",
        "“Can you change me a hundred-dollar bill?” he demanded.",
        "The bartender was a big, husky fellow, with the jaw of a prize fighter,\r\nand a three weeks’ stubble of hair upon it.",
        "He stared at Jurgis.",
        "“What’s that youse say?” he demanded.",
        "“I said, could you change me a hundred-dollar bill?”\r\n\r\n“Where’d youse get it?” he inquired incredulously.",
        "“Never mind,” said Jurgis; “I’ve got it, and I want it changed.",
        "I’ll\r\npay you if you’ll do it.”\r\n\r\nThe other stared at him hard.",
        "“Lemme see it,” he said.",
        "“Will you change it?” Jurgis demanded, gripping it tightly in his\r\npocket.",
        "“How the hell can I know if it’s good or not?” retorted the bartender.",
        "“Whatcher take me for, hey?”\r\n\r\nThen Jurgis slowly and warily approached him; he took out the bill, and\r\nfumbled it for a moment, while the man stared at him with hostile eyes\r\nacross the counter.",
        "Then finally he handed it over.",
        "The other took it, and began to examine it; he smoothed it between his\r\nfingers, and held it up to the light; he turned it over, and upside\r\ndown, and edgeways.",
        "It was new and rather stiff, and that made him\r\ndubious.",
        "Jurgis was watching him like a cat all the time.",
        "“Humph,” he said, finally, and gazed at the stranger, sizing him up—a\r\nragged, ill-smelling tramp, with no overcoat and one arm in a sling—and\r\na hundred-dollar bill!",
        "“Want to buy anything?” he demanded.",
        "“Yes,” said Jurgis, “I’ll take a glass of beer.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the other, “I’ll change it.” And he put the bill in\r\nhis pocket, and poured Jurgis out a glass of beer, and set it on the\r\ncounter.",
        "Then he turned to the cash register, and punched up five\r\ncents, and began to pull money out of the drawer.",
        "Finally, he faced\r\nJurgis, counting it out—two dimes, a quarter, and fifty cents.",
        "“There,”\r\nhe said.",
        "For a second Jurgis waited, expecting to see him turn again.",
        "“My\r\nninety-nine dollars,” he said.",
        "“What ninety-nine dollars?” demanded the bartender.",
        "“My change!” he cried—“the rest of my hundred!”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said the bartender, “you’re nutty!”\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis stared at him with wild eyes.",
        "For an instant horror reigned\r\nin him—black, paralyzing, awful horror, clutching him at the heart; and\r\nthen came rage, in surging, blinding floods—he screamed aloud, and\r\nseized the glass and hurled it at the other’s head.",
        "The man ducked, and\r\nit missed him by half an inch; he rose again and faced Jurgis, who was\r\nvaulting over the bar with his one well arm, and dealt him a smashing\r\nblow in the face, hurling him backward upon the floor.",
        "Then, as Jurgis\r\nscrambled to his feet again and started round the counter after him, he\r\nshouted at the top of his voice, “Help!",
        "help!”\r\n\r\nJurgis seized a bottle off the counter as he ran; and as the bartender\r\nmade a leap he hurled the missile at him with all his force.",
        "It just\r\ngrazed his head, and shivered into a thousand pieces against the post\r\nof the door.",
        "Then Jurgis started back, rushing at the man again in the\r\nmiddle of the room.",
        "This time, in his blind frenzy, he came without a\r\nbottle, and that was all the bartender wanted—he met him halfway and\r\nfloored him with a sledgehammer drive between the eyes.",
        "An instant\r\nlater the screen doors flew open, and two men rushed in—just as Jurgis\r\nwas getting to his feet again, foaming at the mouth with rage, and\r\ntrying to tear his broken arm out of its bandages.",
        "“Look out!” shouted the bartender.",
        "“He’s got a knife!” Then, seeing\r\nthat the two were disposed to join the fray, he made another rush at\r\nJurgis, and knocked aside his feeble defense and sent him tumbling\r\nagain; and the three flung themselves upon him, rolling and kicking\r\nabout the place.",
        "A second later a policeman dashed in, and the bartender yelled once\r\nmore—“Look out for his knife!” Jurgis had fought himself half to his\r\nknees, when the policeman made a leap at him, and cracked him across\r\nthe face with his club.",
        "Though the blow staggered him, the wild-beast\r\nfrenzy still blazed in him, and he got to his feet, lunging into the\r\nair.",
        "Then again the club descended, full upon his head, and he dropped\r\nlike a log to the floor.",
        "The policeman crouched over him, clutching his stick, waiting for him\r\nto try to rise again; and meantime the barkeeper got up, and put his\r\nhand to his head.",
        "“Christ!” he said, “I thought I was done for that\r\ntime.",
        "Did he cut me?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t see anything, Jake,” said the policeman.",
        "“What’s the matter with\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“Just crazy drunk,” said the other.",
        "“A lame duck, too—but he ’most got\r\nme under the bar.",
        "Youse had better call the wagon, Billy.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the officer.",
        "“He’s got no more fight in him, I guess—and\r\nhe’s only got a block to go.” He twisted his hand in Jurgis’s collar\r\nand jerked at him.",
        "“Git up here, you!” he commanded.",
        "But Jurgis did not move, and the bartender went behind the bar, and\r\nafter stowing the hundred-dollar bill away in a safe hiding place, came\r\nand poured a glass of water over Jurgis.",
        "Then, as the latter began to\r\nmoan feebly, the policeman got him to his feet and dragged him out of\r\nthe place.",
        "The station house was just around the corner, and so in a\r\nfew minutes Jurgis was in a cell.",
        "He spent half the night lying unconscious, and the balance moaning in\r\ntorment, with a blinding headache and a racking thirst.",
        "Now and then he\r\ncried aloud for a drink of water, but there was no one to hear him.",
        "There were others in that same station house with split heads and a\r\nfever; there were hundreds of them in the great city, and tens of\r\nthousands of them in the great land, and there was no one to hear any\r\nof them.",
        "In the morning Jurgis was given a cup of water and a piece of bread,\r\nand then hustled into a patrol wagon and driven to the nearest police\r\ncourt.",
        "He sat in the pen with a score of others until his turn came.",
        "The bartender—who proved to be a well-known bruiser—was called to the\r\nstand.",
        "He took the oath and told his story.",
        "The prisoner had come into\r\nhis saloon after midnight, fighting drunk, and had ordered a glass of\r\nbeer and tendered a dollar bill in payment.",
        "He had been given\r\nninety-five cents’ change, and had demanded ninety-nine dollars more,\r\nand before the plaintiff could even answer had hurled the glass at him\r\nand then attacked him with a bottle of bitters, and nearly wrecked the\r\nplace.",
        "Then the prisoner was sworn—a forlorn object, haggard and unshorn, with\r\nan arm done up in a filthy bandage, a cheek and head cut, and bloody,\r\nand one eye purplish black and entirely closed.",
        "“What have you to say\r\nfor yourself?” queried the magistrate.",
        "“Your Honor,” said Jurgis, “I went into his place and asked the man if\r\nhe could change me a hundred-dollar bill.",
        "And he said he would if I\r\nbought a drink.",
        "I gave him the bill and then he wouldn’t give me the\r\nchange.”\r\n\r\nThe magistrate was staring at him in perplexity.",
        "“You gave him a\r\nhundred-dollar bill!” he exclaimed.",
        "“Yes, your Honor,” said Jurgis.",
        "“Where did you get it?”\r\n\r\n“A man gave it to me, your Honor.”\r\n\r\n“A man?",
        "What man, and what for?”\r\n\r\n“A young man I met upon the street, your Honor.",
        "I had been begging.”\r\n\r\nThere was a titter in the courtroom; the officer who was holding Jurgis\r\nput up his hand to hide a smile, and the magistrate smiled without\r\ntrying to hide it.",
        "“It’s true, your Honor!” cried Jurgis, passionately.",
        "“You had been drinking as well as begging last night, had you not?”\r\ninquired the magistrate.",
        "“No, your Honor—” protested Jurgis.",
        "“I—”\r\n\r\n“You had not had anything to drink?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, your Honor, I had—”\r\n\r\n“What did you have?”\r\n\r\n“I had a bottle of something—I don’t know what it was—something that\r\nburned—”\r\n\r\nThere was again a laugh round the courtroom, stopping suddenly as the\r\nmagistrate looked up and frowned.",
        "“Have you ever been arrested before?”\r\nhe asked abruptly.",
        "The question took Jurgis aback.",
        "“I—I—” he stammered.",
        "“Tell me the truth, now!” commanded the other, sternly.",
        "“Yes, your Honor,” said Jurgis.",
        "“How often?”\r\n\r\n“Only once, your Honor.”\r\n\r\n“What for?”\r\n\r\n“For knocking down my boss, your Honor.",
        "I was working in the\r\nstockyards, and he—”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said his Honor; “I guess that will do.",
        "You ought to stop\r\ndrinking if you can’t control yourself.",
        "Ten days and costs.",
        "Next case.”\r\n\r\nJurgis gave vent to a cry of dismay, cut off suddenly by the policeman,\r\nwho seized him by the collar.",
        "He was jerked out of the way, into a room\r\nwith the convicted prisoners, where he sat and wept like a child in his\r\nimpotent rage.",
        "It seemed monstrous to him that policemen and judges\r\nshould esteem his word as nothing in comparison with the\r\nbartender’s—poor Jurgis could not know that the owner of the saloon\r\npaid five dollars each week to the policeman alone for Sunday\r\nprivileges and general favors—nor that the pugilist bartender was one\r\nof the most trusted henchmen of the Democratic leader of the district,\r\nand had helped only a few months before to hustle out a record-breaking\r\nvote as a testimonial to the magistrate, who had been made the target\r\nof odious kid-gloved reformers.",
        "Jurgis was driven out to the Bridewell for the second time.",
        "In his\r\ntumbling around he had hurt his arm again, and so could not work, but\r\nhad to be attended by the physician.",
        "Also his head and his eye had to\r\nbe tied up—and so he was a pretty-looking object when, the second day\r\nafter his arrival, he went out into the exercise court and\r\nencountered—Jack Duane!",
        "The young fellow was so glad to see Jurgis that he almost hugged him.",
        "“By God, if it isn’t ‘the Stinker’!” he cried.",
        "“And what is it—have you\r\nbeen through a sausage machine?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jurgis, “but I’ve been in a railroad wreck and a fight.” And\r\nthen, while some of the other prisoners gathered round he told his wild\r\nstory; most of them were incredulous, but Duane knew that Jurgis could\r\nnever have made up such a yarn as that.",
        "“Hard luck, old man,” he said, when they were alone; “but maybe it’s\r\ntaught you a lesson.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve learned some things since I saw you last,” said Jurgis\r\nmournfully.",
        "Then he explained how he had spent the last summer,\r\n“hoboing it,” as the phrase was.",
        "“And you?” he asked finally.",
        "“Have you\r\nbeen here ever since?”\r\n\r\n“Lord, no!” said the other.",
        "“I only came in the day before yesterday.",
        "It’s the second time they’ve sent me up on a trumped-up charge—I’ve had\r\nhard luck and can’t pay them what they want.",
        "Why don’t you quit Chicago\r\nwith me, Jurgis?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no place to go,” said Jurgis, sadly.",
        "“Neither have I,” replied the other, laughing lightly.",
        "“But we’ll wait\r\ntill we get out and see.”\r\n\r\nIn the Bridewell Jurgis met few who had been there the last time, but\r\nhe met scores of others, old and young, of exactly the same sort.",
        "It\r\nwas like breakers upon a beach; there was new water, but the wave\r\nlooked just the same.",
        "He strolled about and talked with them, and the\r\nbiggest of them told tales of their prowess, while those who were\r\nweaker, or younger and inexperienced, gathered round and listened in\r\nadmiring silence.",
        "The last time he was there, Jurgis had thought of\r\nlittle but his family; but now he was free to listen to these men, and\r\nto realize that he was one of them—that their point of view was his\r\npoint of view, and that the way they kept themselves alive in the world\r\nwas the way he meant to do it in the future.",
        "And so, when he was turned out of prison again, without a penny in his\r\npocket, he went straight to Jack Duane.",
        "He went full of humility and\r\ngratitude; for Duane was a gentleman, and a man with a profession—and\r\nit was remarkable that he should be willing to throw in his lot with a\r\nhumble workingman, one who had even been a beggar and a tramp.",
        "Jurgis\r\ncould not see what help he could be to him; but he did not understand\r\nthat a man like himself—who could be trusted to stand by any one who\r\nwas kind to him—was as rare among criminals as among any other class of\r\nmen.",
        "The address Jurgis had was a garret room in the Ghetto district, the\r\nhome of a pretty little French girl, Duane’s mistress, who sewed all\r\nday, and eked out her living by prostitution.",
        "He had gone elsewhere,\r\nshe told Jurgis—he was afraid to stay there now, on account of the\r\npolice.",
        "The new address was a cellar dive, whose proprietor said that\r\nhe had never heard of Duane; but after he had put Jurgis through a\r\ncatechism he showed him a back stairs which led to a “fence” in the\r\nrear of a pawnbroker’s shop, and thence to a number of assignation\r\nrooms, in one of which Duane was hiding.",
        "Duane was glad to see him; he was without a cent of money, he said, and\r\nhad been waiting for Jurgis to help him get some.",
        "He explained his\r\nplan—in fact he spent the day in laying bare to his friend the criminal\r\nworld of the city, and in showing him how he might earn himself a\r\nliving in it.",
        "That winter he would have a hard time, on account of his\r\narm, and because of an unwonted fit of activity of the police; but so\r\nlong as he was unknown to them he would be safe if he were careful.",
        "Here at “Papa” Hanson’s (so they called the old man who kept the dive)\r\nhe might rest at ease, for “Papa” Hanson was “square”—would stand by\r\nhim so long as he paid, and gave him an hour’s notice if there were to\r\nbe a police raid.",
        "Also Rosensteg, the pawnbroker, would buy anything he\r\nhad for a third of its value, and guarantee to keep it hidden for a\r\nyear.",
        "There was an oil stove in the little cupboard of a room, and they had\r\nsome supper; and then about eleven o’clock at night they sallied forth\r\ntogether, by a rear entrance to the place, Duane armed with a\r\nslingshot.",
        "They came to a residence district, and he sprang up a\r\nlamppost and blew out the light, and then the two dodged into the\r\nshelter of an area step and hid in silence.",
        "Pretty soon a man came by, a workingman—and they let him go.",
        "Then after\r\na long interval came the heavy tread of a policeman, and they held\r\ntheir breath till he was gone.",
        "Though half-frozen, they waited a full\r\nquarter of an hour after that—and then again came footsteps, walking\r\nbriskly.",
        "Duane nudged Jurgis, and the instant the man had passed they\r\nrose up.",
        "Duane stole out as silently as a shadow, and a second later\r\nJurgis heard a thud and a stifled cry.",
        "He was only a couple of feet\r\nbehind, and he leaped to stop the man’s mouth, while Duane held him\r\nfast by the arms, as they had agreed.",
        "But the man was limp and showed a\r\ntendency to fall, and so Jurgis had only to hold him by the collar,\r\nwhile the other, with swift fingers, went through his pockets—ripping\r\nopen, first his overcoat, and then his coat, and then his vest,\r\nsearching inside and outside, and transferring the contents into his\r\nown pockets.",
        "At last, after feeling of the man’s fingers and in his\r\nnecktie, Duane whispered, “That’s all!” and they dragged him to the\r\narea and dropped him in.",
        "Then Jurgis went one way and his friend the\r\nother, walking briskly.",
        "The latter arrived first, and Jurgis found him examining the “swag.”\r\nThere was a gold watch, for one thing, with a chain and locket; there\r\nwas a silver pencil, and a matchbox, and a handful of small change, and\r\nfinally a card-case.",
        "This last Duane opened feverishly—there were\r\nletters and checks, and two theater-tickets, and at last, in the back\r\npart, a wad of bills.",
        "He counted them—there was a twenty, five tens,\r\nfour fives, and three ones.",
        "Duane drew a long breath.",
        "“That lets us\r\nout!” he said.",
        "After further examination, they burned the card-case and its contents,\r\nall but the bills, and likewise the picture of a little girl in the\r\nlocket.",
        "Then Duane took the watch and trinkets downstairs, and came\r\nback with sixteen dollars.",
        "“The old scoundrel said the case was\r\nfilled,” he said.",
        "“It’s a lie, but he knows I want the money.”\r\n\r\nThey divided up the spoils, and Jurgis got as his share fifty-five\r\ndollars and some change.",
        "He protested that it was too much, but the\r\nother had agreed to divide even.",
        "That was a good haul, he said, better\r\nthan average.",
        "When they got up in the morning, Jurgis was sent out to buy a paper;\r\none of the pleasures of committing a crime was the reading about it\r\nafterward.",
        "“I had a pal that always did it,” Duane remarked,\r\nlaughing—“until one day he read that he had left three thousand dollars\r\nin a lower inside pocket of his party’s vest!”\r\n\r\nThere was a half-column account of the robbery—it was evident that a\r\ngang was operating in the neighborhood, said the paper, for it was the\r\nthird within a week, and the police were apparently powerless.",
        "The\r\nvictim was an insurance agent, and he had lost a hundred and ten\r\ndollars that did not belong to him.",
        "He had chanced to have his name\r\nmarked on his shirt, otherwise he would not have been identified yet.",
        "His assailant had hit him too hard, and he was suffering from\r\nconcussion of the brain; and also he had been half-frozen when found,\r\nand would lose three fingers on his right hand.",
        "The enterprising\r\nnewspaper reporter had taken all this information to his family, and\r\ntold how they had received it.",
        "Since it was Jurgis’s first experience, these details naturally caused\r\nhim some worriment; but the other laughed coolly—it was the way of the\r\ngame, and there was no helping it.",
        "Before long Jurgis would think no\r\nmore of it than they did in the yards of knocking out a bullock.",
        "“It’s\r\na case of us or the other fellow, and I say the other fellow, every\r\ntime,” he observed.",
        "“Still,” said Jurgis, reflectively, “he never did us any harm.”\r\n\r\n“He was doing it to somebody as hard as he could, you can be sure of\r\nthat,” said his friend.",
        "Duane had already explained to Jurgis that if a man of their trade were\r\nknown he would have to work all the time to satisfy the demands of the\r\npolice.",
        "Therefore it would be better for Jurgis to stay in hiding and\r\nnever be seen in public with his pal.",
        "But Jurgis soon got very tired of\r\nstaying in hiding.",
        "In a couple of weeks he was feeling strong and\r\nbeginning to use his arm, and then he could not stand it any longer.",
        "Duane, who had done a job of some sort by himself, and made a truce\r\nwith the powers, brought over Marie, his little French girl, to share\r\nwith him; but even that did not avail for long, and in the end he had\r\nto give up arguing, and take Jurgis out and introduce him to the\r\nsaloons and “sporting houses” where the big crooks and “holdup men”\r\nhung out.",
        "And so Jurgis got a glimpse of the high-class criminal world of\r\nChicago.",
        "The city, which was owned by an oligarchy of business men,\r\nbeing nominally ruled by the people, a huge army of graft was necessary\r\nfor the purpose of effecting the transfer of power.",
        "Twice a year, in\r\nthe spring and fall elections, millions of dollars were furnished by\r\nthe business men and expended by this army; meetings were held and\r\nclever speakers were hired, bands played and rockets sizzled, tons of\r\ndocuments and reservoirs of drinks were distributed, and tens of\r\nthousands of votes were bought for cash.",
        "And this army of graft had, of\r\ncourse, to be maintained the year round.",
        "The leaders and organizers\r\nwere maintained by the business men directly—aldermen and legislators\r\nby means of bribes, party officials out of the campaign funds,\r\nlobbyists and corporation lawyers in the form of salaries, contractors\r\nby means of jobs, labor union leaders by subsidies, and newspaper\r\nproprietors and editors by advertisements.",
        "The rank and file, however,\r\nwere either foisted upon the city, or else lived off the population\r\ndirectly.",
        "There was the police department, and the fire and water\r\ndepartments, and the whole balance of the civil list, from the meanest\r\noffice boy to the head of a city department; and for the horde who\r\ncould find no room in these, there was the world of vice and crime,\r\nthere was license to seduce, to swindle and plunder and prey.",
        "The law\r\nforbade Sunday drinking; and this had delivered the saloon-keepers into\r\nthe hands of the police, and made an alliance between them necessary.",
        "The law forbade prostitution; and this had brought the “madames” into\r\nthe combination.",
        "It was the same with the gambling-house keeper and the\r\npoolroom man, and the same with any other man or woman who had a means\r\nof getting “graft,” and was willing to pay over a share of it: the\r\ngreen-goods man and the highwayman, the pickpocket and the sneak thief,\r\nand the receiver of stolen goods, the seller of adulterated milk, of\r\nstale fruit and diseased meat, the proprietor of unsanitary tenements,\r\nthe fake doctor and the usurer, the beggar and the “pushcart man,” the\r\nprize fighter and the professional slugger, the race-track “tout,” the\r\nprocurer, the white-slave agent, and the expert seducer of young girls.",
        "All of these agencies of corruption were banded together, and leagued\r\nin blood brotherhood with the politician and the police; more often\r\nthan not they were one and the same person,—the police captain would\r\nown the brothel he pretended to raid, the politician would open his\r\nheadquarters in his saloon.",
        "“Hinkydink” or “Bathhouse John,” or others\r\nof that ilk, were proprietors of the most notorious dives in Chicago,\r\nand also the “gray wolves” of the city council, who gave away the\r\nstreets of the city to the business men; and those who patronized their\r\nplaces were the gamblers and prize fighters who set the law at\r\ndefiance, and the burglars and holdup men who kept the whole city in\r\nterror.",
        "On election day all these powers of vice and crime were one\r\npower; they could tell within one per cent what the vote of their\r\ndistrict would be, and they could change it at an hour’s notice.",
        "A month ago Jurgis had all but perished of starvation upon the streets;\r\nand now suddenly, as by the gift of a magic key, he had entered into a\r\nworld where money and all the good things of life came freely.",
        "He was\r\nintroduced by his friend to an Irishman named “Buck” Halloran, who was\r\na political “worker” and on the inside of things.",
        "This man talked with\r\nJurgis for a while, and then told him that he had a little plan by\r\nwhich a man who looked like a workingman might make some easy money;\r\nbut it was a private affair, and had to be kept quiet.",
        "Jurgis expressed\r\nhimself as agreeable, and the other took him that afternoon (it was\r\nSaturday) to a place where city laborers were being paid off.",
        "The\r\npaymaster sat in a little booth, with a pile of envelopes before him,\r\nand two policemen standing by.",
        "Jurgis went, according to directions,\r\nand gave the name of “Michael O’Flaherty,” and received an envelope,\r\nwhich he took around the corner and delivered to Halloran, who was\r\nwaiting for him in a saloon.",
        "Then he went again; and gave the name of\r\n“Johann Schmidt,” and a third time, and give the name of “Serge\r\nReminitsky.” Halloran had quite a list of imaginary workingmen, and\r\nJurgis got an envelope for each one.",
        "For this work he received five\r\ndollars, and was told that he might have it every week, so long as he\r\nkept quiet.",
        "As Jurgis was excellent at keeping quiet, he soon won the\r\ntrust of “Buck” Halloran, and was introduced to others as a man who\r\ncould be depended upon.",
        "This acquaintance was useful to him in another way, also before long\r\nJurgis made his discovery of the meaning of “pull,” and just why his\r\nboss, Connor, and also the pugilist bartender, had been able to send\r\nhim to jail.",
        "One night there was given a ball, the “benefit” of\r\n“One-eyed Larry,” a lame man who played the violin in one of the big\r\n“high-class” houses of prostitution on Clark Street, and was a wag and\r\na popular character on the “Lêvée.” This ball was held in a big dance\r\nhall, and was one of the occasions when the city’s powers of debauchery\r\ngave themselves up to madness.",
        "Jurgis attended and got half insane with\r\ndrink, and began quarreling over a girl; his arm was pretty strong by\r\nthen, and he set to work to clean out the place, and ended in a cell in\r\nthe police station.",
        "The police station being crowded to the doors, and\r\nstinking with “bums,” Jurgis did not relish staying there to sleep off\r\nhis liquor, and sent for Halloran, who called up the district leader\r\nand had Jurgis bailed out by telephone at four o’clock in the morning.",
        "When he was arraigned that same morning, the district leader had\r\nalready seen the clerk of the court and explained that Jurgis Rudkus\r\nwas a decent fellow, who had been indiscreet; and so Jurgis was fined\r\nten dollars and the fine was “suspended”—which meant that he did not\r\nhave to pay for it, and never would have to pay it, unless somebody\r\nchose to bring it up against him in the future.",
        "Among the people Jurgis lived with now money was valued according to an\r\nentirely different standard from that of the people of Packingtown;\r\nyet, strange as it may seem, he did a great deal less drinking than he\r\nhad as a workingman.",
        "He had not the same provocations of exhaustion and\r\nhopelessness; he had now something to work for, to struggle for.",
        "He\r\nsoon found that if he kept his wits about him, he would come upon new\r\nopportunities; and being naturally an active man, he not only kept\r\nsober himself, but helped to steady his friend, who was a good deal\r\nfonder of both wine and women than he.",
        "One thing led to another.",
        "In the saloon where Jurgis met “Buck”\r\nHalloran he was sitting late one night with Duane, when a “country\r\ncustomer” (a buyer for an out-of-town merchant) came in, a little more\r\nthan half “piped.” There was no one else in the place but the\r\nbartender, and as the man went out again Jurgis and Duane followed him;\r\nhe went round the corner, and in a dark place made by a combination of\r\nthe elevated railroad and an unrented building, Jurgis leaped forward\r\nand shoved a revolver under his nose, while Duane, with his hat pulled\r\nover his eyes, went through the man’s pockets with lightning fingers.",
        "They got his watch and his “wad,” and were round the corner again and\r\ninto the saloon before he could shout more than once.",
        "The bartender, to\r\nwhom they had tipped the wink, had the cellar door open for them, and\r\nthey vanished, making their way by a secret entrance to a brothel next\r\ndoor.",
        "From the roof of this there was access to three similar places\r\nbeyond.",
        "By means of these passages the customers of any one place could\r\nbe gotten out of the way, in case a falling out with the police chanced\r\nto lead to a raid; and also it was necessary to have a way of getting a\r\ngirl out of reach in case of an emergency.",
        "Thousands of them came to\r\nChicago answering advertisements for “servants” and “factory hands,”\r\nand found themselves trapped by fake employment agencies, and locked up\r\nin a bawdy-house.",
        "It was generally enough to take all their clothes\r\naway from them; but sometimes they would have to be “doped” and kept\r\nprisoners for weeks; and meantime their parents might be telegraphing\r\nthe police, and even coming on to see why nothing was done.",
        "Occasionally there was no way of satisfying them but to let them search\r\nthe place to which the girl had been traced.",
        "For his help in this little job, the bartender received twenty out of\r\nthe hundred and thirty odd dollars that the pair secured; and naturally\r\nthis put them on friendly terms with him, and a few days later he\r\nintroduced them to a little “sheeny” named Goldberger, one of the\r\n“runners” of the “sporting house” where they had been hidden.",
        "After a\r\nfew drinks Goldberger began, with some hesitation, to narrate how he\r\nhad had a quarrel over his best girl with a professional “cardsharp,”\r\nwho had hit him in the jaw.",
        "The fellow was a stranger in Chicago, and\r\nif he was found some night with his head cracked there would be no one\r\nto care very much.",
        "Jurgis, who by this time would cheerfully have\r\ncracked the heads of all the gamblers in Chicago, inquired what would\r\nbe coming to him; at which the Jew became still more confidential, and\r\nsaid that he had some tips on the New Orleans races, which he got\r\ndirect from the police captain of the district, whom he had got out of\r\na bad scrape, and who “stood in” with a big syndicate of horse owners.",
        "Duane took all this in at once, but Jurgis had to have the whole\r\nrace-track situation explained to him before he realized the importance\r\nof such an opportunity.",
        "There was the gigantic Racing Trust.",
        "It owned the legislatures in every\r\nstate in which it did business; it even owned some of the big\r\nnewspapers, and made public opinion—there was no power in the land that\r\ncould oppose it unless, perhaps, it were the Poolroom Trust.",
        "It built\r\nmagnificent racing parks all over the country, and by means of enormous\r\npurses it lured the people to come, and then it organized a gigantic\r\nshell game, whereby it plundered them of hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars every year.",
        "Horse racing had once been a sport, but nowadays it\r\nwas a business; a horse could be “doped” and doctored, undertrained or\r\novertrained; it could be made to fall at any moment—or its gait could\r\nbe broken by lashing it with the whip, which all the spectators would\r\ntake to be a desperate effort to keep it in the lead.",
        "There were scores\r\nof such tricks; and sometimes it was the owners who played them and\r\nmade fortunes, sometimes it was the jockeys and trainers, sometimes it\r\nwas outsiders, who bribed them—but most of the time it was the chiefs\r\nof the trust.",
        "Now for instance, they were having winter racing in New\r\nOrleans and a syndicate was laying out each day’s program in advance,\r\nand its agents in all the Northern cities were “milking” the poolrooms.",
        "The word came by long-distance telephone in a cipher code, just a\r\nlittle while before each race; and any man who could get the secret had\r\nas good as a fortune.",
        "If Jurgis did not believe it, he could try it,\r\nsaid the little Jew—let them meet at a certain house on the morrow and\r\nmake a test.",
        "Jurgis was willing, and so was Duane, and so they went to\r\none of the high-class poolrooms where brokers and merchants gambled\r\n(with society women in a private room), and they put up ten dollars\r\neach upon a horse called “Black Beldame,” a six to one shot, and won.",
        "For a secret like that they would have done a good many sluggings—but\r\nthe next day Goldberger informed them that the offending gambler had\r\ngot wind of what was coming to him, and had skipped the town.",
        "There were ups and downs at the business; but there was always a\r\nliving, inside of a jail, if not out of it.",
        "Early in April the city\r\nelections were due, and that meant prosperity for all the powers of\r\ngraft.",
        "Jurgis, hanging round in dives and gambling houses and brothels,\r\nmet with the heelers of both parties, and from their conversation he\r\ncame to understand all the ins and outs of the game, and to hear of a\r\nnumber of ways in which he could make himself useful about election\r\ntime.",
        "“Buck” Halloran was a “Democrat,” and so Jurgis became a Democrat\r\nalso; but he was not a bitter one—the Republicans were good fellows,\r\ntoo, and were to have a pile of money in this next campaign.",
        "At the\r\nlast election the Republicans had paid four dollars a vote to the\r\nDemocrats’ three; and “Buck” Halloran sat one night playing cards with\r\nJurgis and another man, who told how Halloran had been charged with the\r\njob voting a “bunch” of thirty-seven newly landed Italians, and how he,\r\nthe narrator, had met the Republican worker who was after the very same\r\ngang, and how the three had effected a bargain, whereby the Italians\r\nwere to vote half and half, for a glass of beer apiece, while the\r\nbalance of the fund went to the conspirators!",
        "Not long after this, Jurgis, wearying of the risks and vicissitudes of\r\nmiscellaneous crime, was moved to give up the career for that of a\r\npolitician.",
        "Just at this time there was a tremendous uproar being\r\nraised concerning the alliance between the criminals and the police.",
        "For the criminal graft was one in which the business men had no direct\r\npart—it was what is called a “side line,” carried by the police.",
        "“Wide\r\nopen” gambling and debauchery made the city pleasing to “trade,” but\r\nburglaries and holdups did not.",
        "One night it chanced that while Jack\r\nDuane was drilling a safe in a clothing store he was caught red-handed\r\nby the night watchman, and turned over to a policeman, who chanced to\r\nknow him well, and who took the responsibility of letting him make his\r\nescape.",
        "Such a howl from the newspapers followed this that Duane was\r\nslated for sacrifice, and barely got out of town in time.",
        "And just at\r\nthat juncture it happened that Jurgis was introduced to a man named\r\nHarper whom he recognized as the night watchman at Brown’s, who had\r\nbeen instrumental in making him an American citizen, the first year of\r\nhis arrival at the yards.",
        "The other was interested in the coincidence,\r\nbut did not remember Jurgis—he had handled too many “green ones” in his\r\ntime, he said.",
        "He sat in a dance hall with Jurgis and Halloran until\r\none or two in the morning, exchanging experiences.",
        "He had a long story\r\nto tell of his quarrel with the superintendent of his department, and\r\nhow he was now a plain workingman, and a good union man as well.",
        "It was\r\nnot until some months afterward that Jurgis understood that the quarrel\r\nwith the superintendent had been prearranged, and that Harper was in\r\nreality drawing a salary of twenty dollars a week from the packers for\r\nan inside report of his union’s secret proceedings.",
        "The yards were\r\nseething with agitation just then, said the man, speaking as a\r\nunionist.",
        "The people of Packingtown had borne about all that they would\r\nbear, and it looked as if a strike might begin any week.",
        "After this talk the man made inquiries concerning Jurgis, and a couple\r\nof days later he came to him with an interesting proposition.",
        "He was\r\nnot absolutely certain, he said, but he thought that he could get him a\r\nregular salary if he would come to Packingtown and do as he was told,\r\nand keep his mouth shut.",
        "Harper—“Bush” Harper, he was called—was a\r\nright-hand man of Mike Scully, the Democratic boss of the stockyards;\r\nand in the coming election there was a peculiar situation.",
        "There had\r\ncome to Scully a proposition to nominate a certain rich brewer who\r\nlived upon a swell boulevard that skirted the district, and who coveted\r\nthe big badge and the “honorable” of an alderman.",
        "The brewer was a Jew,\r\nand had no brains, but he was harmless, and would put up a rare\r\ncampaign fund.",
        "Scully had accepted the offer, and then gone to the\r\nRepublicans with a proposition.",
        "He was not sure that he could manage\r\nthe “sheeny,” and he did not mean to take any chances with his\r\ndistrict; let the Republicans nominate a certain obscure but amiable\r\nfriend of Scully’s, who was now setting tenpins in the cellar of an\r\nAshland Avenue saloon, and he, Scully, would elect him with the\r\n“sheeny’s” money, and the Republicans might have the glory, which was\r\nmore than they would get otherwise.",
        "In return for this the Republicans\r\nwould agree to put up no candidate the following year, when Scully\r\nhimself came up for reelection as the other alderman from the ward.",
        "To\r\nthis the Republicans had assented at once; but the hell of it was—so\r\nHarper explained—that the Republicans were all of them fools—a man had\r\nto be a fool to be a Republican in the stockyards, where Scully was\r\nking.",
        "And they didn’t know how to work, and of course it would not do\r\nfor the Democratic workers, the noble redskins of the War Whoop League,\r\nto support the Republican openly.",
        "The difficulty would not have been so\r\ngreat except for another fact—there had been a curious development in\r\nstockyards politics in the last year or two, a new party having leaped\r\ninto being.",
        "They were the Socialists; and it was a devil of a mess,\r\nsaid “Bush” Harper.",
        "The one image which the word “Socialist” brought to\r\nJurgis was of poor little Tamoszius Kuszleika, who had called himself\r\none, and would go out with a couple of other men and a soap-box, and\r\nshout himself hoarse on a street corner Saturday nights.",
        "Tamoszius had\r\ntried to explain to Jurgis what it was all about, but Jurgis, who was\r\nnot of an imaginative turn, had never quite got it straight; at present\r\nhe was content with his companion’s explanation that the Socialists\r\nwere the enemies of American institutions—could not be bought, and\r\nwould not combine or make any sort of a “dicker.” Mike Scully was very\r\nmuch worried over the opportunity which his last deal gave to them—the\r\nstockyards Democrats were furious at the idea of a rich capitalist for\r\ntheir candidate, and while they were changing they might possibly\r\nconclude that a Socialist firebrand was preferable to a Republican bum.",
        "And so right here was a chance for Jurgis to make himself a place in\r\nthe world, explained “Bush” Harper; he had been a union man, and he was\r\nknown in the yards as a workingman; he must have hundreds of\r\nacquaintances, and as he had never talked politics with them he might\r\ncome out as a Republican now without exciting the least suspicion.",
        "There were barrels of money for the use of those who could deliver the\r\ngoods; and Jurgis might count upon Mike Scully, who had never yet gone\r\nback on a friend.",
        "Just what could he do?",
        "Jurgis asked, in some\r\nperplexity, and the other explained in detail.",
        "To begin with, he would\r\nhave to go to the yards and work, and he mightn’t relish that; but he\r\nwould have what he earned, as well as the rest that came to him.",
        "He\r\nwould get active in the union again, and perhaps try to get an office,\r\nas he, Harper, had; he would tell all his friends the good points of\r\nDoyle, the Republican nominee, and the bad ones of the “sheeny”; and\r\nthen Scully would furnish a meeting place, and he would start the\r\n“Young Men’s Republican Association,” or something of that sort, and\r\nhave the rich brewer’s best beer by the hogshead, and fireworks and\r\nspeeches, just like the War Whoop League.",
        "Surely Jurgis must know\r\nhundreds of men who would like that sort of fun; and there would be the\r\nregular Republican leaders and workers to help him out, and they would\r\ndeliver a big enough majority on election day.",
        "When he had heard all this explanation to the end, Jurgis demanded:\r\n“But how can I get a job in Packingtown?",
        "I’m blacklisted.”\r\n\r\nAt which “Bush” Harper laughed.",
        "“I’ll attend to that all right,” he\r\nsaid.",
        "And the other replied, “It’s a go, then; I’m your man.” So Jurgis went\r\nout to the stockyards again, and was introduced to the political lord\r\nof the district, the boss of Chicago’s mayor.",
        "It was Scully who owned\r\nthe brick-yards and the dump and the ice pond—though Jurgis did not\r\nknow it.",
        "It was Scully who was to blame for the unpaved street in which\r\nJurgis’s child had been drowned; it was Scully who had put into office\r\nthe magistrate who had first sent Jurgis to jail; it was Scully who was\r\nprincipal stockholder in the company which had sold him the ramshackle\r\ntenement, and then robbed him of it.",
        "But Jurgis knew none of these\r\nthings—any more than he knew that Scully was but a tool and puppet of\r\nthe packers.",
        "To him Scully was a mighty power, the “biggest” man he had\r\never met.",
        "He was a little, dried-up Irishman, whose hands shook.",
        "He had a brief\r\ntalk with his visitor, watching him with his ratlike eyes, and making\r\nup his mind about him; and then he gave him a note to Mr.",
        "Harmon, one\r\nof the head managers of Durham’s—\r\n\r\n“The bearer, Jurgis Rudkus, is a particular friend of mine, and I would\r\nlike you to find him a good place, for important reasons.",
        "He was once\r\nindiscreet, but you will perhaps be so good as to overlook that.”\r\n\r\nMr.",
        "Harmon looked up inquiringly when he read this.",
        "“What does he mean\r\nby ‘indiscreet’?” he asked.",
        "“I was blacklisted, sir,” said Jurgis.",
        "At which the other frowned.",
        "“Blacklisted?” he said.",
        "“How do you mean?”\r\nAnd Jurgis turned red with embarrassment.",
        "He had forgotten that a blacklist did not exist.",
        "“I—that is—I had\r\ndifficulty in getting a place,” he stammered.",
        "“What was the matter?”\r\n\r\n“I got into a quarrel with a foreman—not my own boss, sir—and struck\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the other, and meditated for a few moments.",
        "“What do you\r\nwish to do?” he asked.",
        "“Anything, sir,” said Jurgis—“only I had a broken arm this winter, and\r\nso I have to be careful.”\r\n\r\n“How would it suit you to be a night watchman?”\r\n\r\n“That wouldn’t do, sir.",
        "I have to be among the men at night.”\r\n\r\n“I see—politics.",
        "Well, would it suit you to trim hogs?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said Jurgis.",
        "And Mr.",
        "Harmon called a timekeeper and said, “Take this man to Pat\r\nMurphy and tell him to find room for him somehow.”\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis marched into the hog-killing room, a place where, in the\r\ndays gone by, he had come begging for a job.",
        "Now he walked jauntily,\r\nand smiled to himself, seeing the frown that came to the boss’s face as\r\nthe timekeeper said, “Mr.",
        "Harmon says to put this man on.” It would\r\novercrowd his department and spoil the record he was trying to make—but\r\nhe said not a word except “All right.”\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis became a workingman once more; and straightway he sought\r\nout his old friends, and joined the union, and began to “root” for\r\n“Scotty” Doyle.",
        "Doyle had done him a good turn once, he explained, and\r\nwas really a bully chap; Doyle was a workingman himself, and would\r\nrepresent the workingmen—why did they want to vote for a millionaire\r\n“sheeny,” and what the hell had Mike Scully ever done for them that\r\nthey should back his candidates all the time?",
        "And meantime Scully had\r\ngiven Jurgis a note to the Republican leader of the ward, and he had\r\ngone there and met the crowd he was to work with.",
        "Already they had\r\nhired a big hall, with some of the brewer’s money, and every night\r\nJurgis brought in a dozen new members of the “Doyle Republican\r\nAssociation.” Pretty soon they had a grand opening night; and there was\r\na brass band, which marched through the streets, and fireworks and\r\nbombs and red lights in front of the hall; and there was an enormous\r\ncrowd, with two overflow meetings—so that the pale and trembling\r\ncandidate had to recite three times over the little speech which one of\r\nScully’s henchmen had written, and which he had been a month learning\r\nby heart.",
        "Best of all, the famous and eloquent Senator Spareshanks,\r\npresidential candidate, rode out in an automobile to discuss the sacred\r\nprivileges of American citizenship, and protection and prosperity for\r\nthe American workingman.",
        "His inspiriting address was quoted to the\r\nextent of half a column in all the morning newspapers, which also said\r\nthat it could be stated upon excellent authority that the unexpected\r\npopularity developed by Doyle, the Republican candidate for alderman,\r\nwas giving great anxiety to Mr.",
        "Scully, the chairman of the Democratic\r\nCity Committee.",
        "The chairman was still more worried when the monster torchlight\r\nprocession came off, with the members of the Doyle Republican\r\nAssociation all in red capes and hats, and free beer for every voter in\r\nthe ward—the best beer ever given away in a political campaign, as the\r\nwhole electorate testified.",
        "During this parade, and at innumerable\r\ncart-tail meetings as well, Jurgis labored tirelessly.",
        "He did not make\r\nany speeches—there were lawyers and other experts for that—but he\r\nhelped to manage things; distributing notices and posting placards and\r\nbringing out the crowds; and when the show was on he attended to the\r\nfireworks and the beer.",
        "Thus in the course of the campaign he handled\r\nmany hundreds of dollars of the Hebrew brewer’s money, administering it\r\nwith naïve and touching fidelity.",
        "Toward the end, however, he learned\r\nthat he was regarded with hatred by the rest of the “boys,” because he\r\ncompelled them either to make a poorer showing than he or to do without\r\ntheir share of the pie.",
        "After that Jurgis did his best to please them,\r\nand to make up for the time he had lost before he discovered the extra\r\nbungholes of the campaign barrel.",
        "He pleased Mike Scully, also.",
        "On election morning he was out at four\r\no’clock, “getting out the vote”; he had a two-horse carriage to ride\r\nin, and he went from house to house for his friends, and escorted them\r\nin triumph to the polls.",
        "He voted half a dozen times himself, and voted\r\nsome of his friends as often; he brought bunch after bunch of the\r\nnewest foreigners—Lithuanians, Poles, Bohemians, Slovaks—and when he\r\nhad put them through the mill he turned them over to another man to\r\ntake to the next polling place.",
        "When Jurgis first set out, the captain\r\nof the precinct gave him a hundred dollars, and three times in the\r\ncourse of the day he came for another hundred, and not more than\r\ntwenty-five out of each lot got stuck in his own pocket.",
        "The balance\r\nall went for actual votes, and on a day of Democratic landslides they\r\nelected “Scotty” Doyle, the ex-tenpin setter, by nearly a thousand\r\nplurality—and beginning at five o’clock in the afternoon, and ending at\r\nthree the next morning, Jurgis treated himself to a most unholy and\r\nhorrible “jag.” Nearly every one else in Packingtown did the same,\r\nhowever, for there was universal exultation over this triumph of\r\npopular government, this crushing defeat of an arrogant plutocrat by\r\nthe power of the common people.",
        "CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the elections Jurgis stayed on in Packingtown and kept his job.",
        "The agitation to break up the police protection of criminals was\r\ncontinuing, and it seemed to him best to “lay low” for the present.",
        "He\r\nhad nearly three hundred dollars in the bank, and might have considered\r\nhimself entitled to a vacation; but he had an easy job, and force of\r\nhabit kept him at it.",
        "Besides, Mike Scully, whom he consulted, advised\r\nhim that something might “turn up” before long.",
        "Jurgis got himself a place in a boardinghouse with some congenial\r\nfriends.",
        "He had already inquired of Aniele, and learned that Elzbieta\r\nand her family had gone downtown, and so he gave no further thought to\r\nthem.",
        "He went with a new set, now, young unmarried fellows who were\r\n“sporty.” Jurgis had long ago cast off his fertilizer clothing, and\r\nsince going into politics he had donned a linen collar and a greasy red\r\nnecktie.",
        "He had some reason for thinking of his dress, for he was\r\nmaking about eleven dollars a week, and two-thirds of it he might spend\r\nupon his pleasures without ever touching his savings.",
        "Sometimes he would ride down-town with a party of friends to the cheap\r\ntheaters and the music halls and other haunts with which they were\r\nfamiliar.",
        "Many of the saloons in Packingtown had pool tables, and some\r\nof them bowling alleys, by means of which he could spend his evenings\r\nin petty gambling.",
        "Also, there were cards and dice.",
        "One time Jurgis got\r\ninto a game on a Saturday night and won prodigiously, and because he\r\nwas a man of spirit he stayed in with the rest and the game continued\r\nuntil late Sunday afternoon, and by that time he was “out” over twenty\r\ndollars.",
        "On Saturday nights, also, a number of balls were generally\r\ngiven in Packingtown; each man would bring his “girl” with him, paying\r\nhalf a dollar for a ticket, and several dollars additional for drinks\r\nin the course of the festivities, which continued until three or four\r\no’clock in the morning, unless broken up by fighting.",
        "During all this\r\ntime the same man and woman would dance together, half-stupefied with\r\nsensuality and drink.",
        "Before long Jurgis discovered what Scully had meant by something\r\n“turning up.” In May the agreement between the packers and the unions\r\nexpired, and a new agreement had to be signed.",
        "Negotiations were going\r\non, and the yards were full of talk of a strike.",
        "The old scale had\r\ndealt with the wages of the skilled men only; and of the members of the\r\nMeat Workers’ Union about two-thirds were unskilled men.",
        "In Chicago\r\nthese latter were receiving, for the most part, eighteen and a half\r\ncents an hour, and the unions wished to make this the general wage for\r\nthe next year.",
        "It was not nearly so large a wage as it seemed—in the\r\ncourse of the negotiations the union officers examined time checks to\r\nthe amount of ten thousand dollars, and they found that the highest\r\nwages paid had been fourteen dollars a week, and the lowest two dollars\r\nand five cents, and the average of the whole, six dollars and\r\nsixty-five cents.",
        "And six dollars and sixty-five cents was hardly too\r\nmuch for a man to keep a family on, considering the fact that the price\r\nof dressed meat had increased nearly fifty per cent in the last five\r\nyears, while the price of “beef on the hoof” had decreased as much, it\r\nwould have seemed that the packers ought to be able to pay it; but the\r\npackers were unwilling to pay it—they rejected the union demand, and to\r\nshow what their purpose was, a week or two after the agreement expired\r\nthey put down the wages of about a thousand men to sixteen and a half\r\ncents, and it was said that old man Jones had vowed he would put them\r\nto fifteen before he got through.",
        "There were a million and a half of\r\nmen in the country looking for work, a hundred thousand of them right\r\nin Chicago; and were the packers to let the union stewards march into\r\ntheir places and bind them to a contract that would lose them several\r\nthousand dollars a day for a year?",
        "Not much!",
        "All this was in June; and before long the question was submitted to a\r\nreferendum in the unions, and the decision was for a strike.",
        "It was the\r\nsame in all the packing house cities; and suddenly the newspapers and\r\npublic woke up to face the gruesome spectacle of a meat famine.",
        "All\r\nsorts of pleas for a reconsideration were made, but the packers were\r\nobdurate; and all the while they were reducing wages, and heading off\r\nshipments of cattle, and rushing in wagon-loads of mattresses and cots.",
        "So the men boiled over, and one night telegrams went out from the union\r\nheadquarters to all the big packing centers—to St.",
        "Paul, South Omaha,\r\nSioux City, St.",
        "Joseph, Kansas City, East St.",
        "Louis, and New York—and\r\nthe next day at noon between fifty and sixty thousand men drew off\r\ntheir working clothes and marched out of the factories, and the great\r\n“Beef Strike” was on.",
        "Jurgis went to his dinner, and afterward he walked over to see Mike\r\nScully, who lived in a fine house, upon a street which had been\r\ndecently paved and lighted for his especial benefit.",
        "Scully had gone\r\ninto semi-retirement, and looked nervous and worried.",
        "“What do you\r\nwant?” he demanded, when he saw Jurgis.",
        "“I came to see if maybe you could get me a place during the strike,”\r\nthe other replied.",
        "And Scully knit his brows and eyed him narrowly.",
        "In that morning’s\r\npapers Jurgis had read a fierce denunciation of the packers by Scully,\r\nwho had declared that if they did not treat their people better the\r\ncity authorities would end the matter by tearing down their plants.",
        "Now, therefore, Jurgis was not a little taken aback when the other\r\ndemanded suddenly, “See here, Rudkus, why don’t you stick by your job?”\r\n\r\nJurgis started.",
        "“Work as a scab?” he cried.",
        "“Why not?” demanded Scully.",
        "“What’s that to you?”\r\n\r\n“But—but—” stammered Jurgis.",
        "He had somehow taken it for granted that\r\nhe should go out with his union.",
        "“The packers need good men, and need\r\nthem bad,” continued the other, “and they’ll treat a man right that\r\nstands by them.",
        "Why don’t you take your chance and fix yourself?”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Jurgis, “how could I ever be of any use to you—in\r\npolitics?”\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t be it anyhow,” said Scully, abruptly.",
        "“Why not?” asked Jurgis.",
        "“Hell, man!” cried the other.",
        "“Don’t you know you’re a Republican?",
        "And\r\ndo you think I’m always going to elect Republicans?",
        "My brewer has found\r\nout already how we served him, and there is the deuce to pay.”\r\n\r\nJurgis looked dumfounded.",
        "He had never thought of that aspect of it\r\nbefore.",
        "“I could be a Democrat,” he said.",
        "“Yes,” responded the other, “but not right away; a man can’t change his\r\npolitics every day.",
        "And besides, I don’t need you—there’d be nothing\r\nfor you to do.",
        "And it’s a long time to election day, anyhow; and what\r\nare you going to do meantime?”\r\n\r\n“I thought I could count on you,” began Jurgis.",
        "“Yes,” responded Scully, “so you could—I never yet went back on a\r\nfriend.",
        "But is it fair to leave the job I got you and come to me for\r\nanother?",
        "I have had a hundred fellows after me today, and what can I\r\ndo?",
        "I’ve put seventeen men on the city payroll to clean streets this\r\none week, and do you think I can keep that up forever?",
        "It wouldn’t do\r\nfor me to tell other men what I tell you, but you’ve been on the\r\ninside, and you ought to have sense enough to see for yourself.",
        "What\r\nhave you to gain by a strike?”\r\n\r\n“I hadn’t thought,” said Jurgis.",
        "“Exactly,” said Scully, “but you’d better.",
        "Take my word for it, the\r\nstrike will be over in a few days, and the men will be beaten; and\r\nmeantime what you can get out of it will belong to you.",
        "Do you see?”\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis saw.",
        "He went back to the yards, and into the workroom.",
        "The\r\nmen had left a long line of hogs in various stages of preparation, and\r\nthe foreman was directing the feeble efforts of a score or two of\r\nclerks and stenographers and office boys to finish up the job and get\r\nthem into the chilling rooms.",
        "Jurgis went straight up to him and\r\nannounced, “I have come back to work, Mr.",
        "Murphy.”\r\n\r\nThe boss’s face lighted up.",
        "“Good man!” he cried.",
        "“Come ahead!”\r\n\r\n“Just a moment,” said Jurgis, checking his enthusiasm.",
        "“I think I ought\r\nto get a little more wages.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the other, “of course.",
        "What do you want?”\r\n\r\nJurgis had debated on the way.",
        "His nerve almost failed him now, but he\r\nclenched his hands.",
        "“I think I ought to have’ three dollars a day,” he\r\nsaid.",
        "“All right,” said the other, promptly; and before the day was out our\r\nfriend discovered that the clerks and stenographers and office boys\r\nwere getting five dollars a day, and then he could have kicked himself!",
        "So Jurgis became one of the new “American heroes,” a man whose virtues\r\nmerited comparison with those of the martyrs of Lexington and Valley\r\nForge.",
        "The resemblance was not complete, of course, for Jurgis was\r\ngenerously paid and comfortably clad, and was provided with a spring\r\ncot and a mattress and three substantial meals a day; also he was\r\nperfectly at ease, and safe from all peril of life and limb, save only\r\nin the case that a desire for beer should lead him to venture outside\r\nof the stockyards gates.",
        "And even in the exercise of this privilege he\r\nwas not left unprotected; a good part of the inadequate police force of\r\nChicago was suddenly diverted from its work of hunting criminals, and\r\nrushed out to serve him.",
        "The police, and the strikers also, were\r\ndetermined that there should be no violence; but there was another\r\nparty interested which was minded to the contrary—and that was the\r\npress.",
        "On the first day of his life as a strikebreaker Jurgis quit work\r\nearly, and in a spirit of bravado he challenged three men of his\r\nacquaintance to go outside and get a drink.",
        "They accepted, and went\r\nthrough the big Halsted Street gate, where several policemen were\r\nwatching, and also some union pickets, scanning sharply those who\r\npassed in and out.",
        "Jurgis and his companions went south on Halsted\r\nStreet; past the hotel, and then suddenly half a dozen men started\r\nacross the street toward them and proceeded to argue with them\r\nconcerning the error of their ways.",
        "As the arguments were not taken in\r\nthe proper spirit, they went on to threats; and suddenly one of them\r\njerked off the hat of one of the four and flung it over the fence.",
        "The\r\nman started after it, and then, as a cry of “Scab!” was raised and a\r\ndozen people came running out of saloons and doorways, a second man’s\r\nheart failed him and he followed.",
        "Jurgis and the fourth stayed long\r\nenough to give themselves the satisfaction of a quick exchange of\r\nblows, and then they, too, took to their heels and fled back of the\r\nhotel and into the yards again.",
        "Meantime, of course, policemen were\r\ncoming on a run, and as a crowd gathered other police got excited and\r\nsent in a riot call.",
        "Jurgis knew nothing of this, but went back to\r\n“Packers’ Avenue,” and in front of the “Central Time Station” he saw\r\none of his companions, breathless and wild with excitement, narrating\r\nto an ever growing throng how the four had been attacked and surrounded\r\nby a howling mob, and had been nearly torn to pieces.",
        "While he stood\r\nlistening, smiling cynically, several dapper young men stood by with\r\nnotebooks in their hands, and it was not more than two hours later that\r\nJurgis saw newsboys running about with armfuls of newspapers, printed\r\nin red and black letters six inches high:\r\n\r\nVIOLENCE IN THE YARDS!",
        "STRIKEBREAKERS SURROUNDED BY FRENZIED MOB!",
        "If he had been able to buy all of the newspapers of the United States\r\nthe next morning, he might have discovered that his beer-hunting\r\nexploit was being perused by some two score millions of people, and had\r\nserved as a text for editorials in half the staid and solemn\r\nbusiness-men’s newspapers in the land.",
        "Jurgis was to see more of this as time passed.",
        "For the present, his\r\nwork being over, he was free to ride into the city, by a railroad\r\ndirect from the yards, or else to spend the night in a room where cots\r\nhad been laid in rows.",
        "He chose the latter, but to his regret, for all\r\nnight long gangs of strikebreakers kept arriving.",
        "As very few of the\r\nbetter class of workingmen could be got for such work, these specimens\r\nof the new American hero contained an assortment of the criminals and\r\nthugs of the city, besides Negroes and the lowest foreigners—Greeks,\r\nRoumanians, Sicilians, and Slovaks.",
        "They had been attracted more by the\r\nprospect of disorder than by the big wages; and they made the night\r\nhideous with singing and carousing, and only went to sleep when the\r\ntime came for them to get up to work.",
        "In the morning before Jurgis had finished his breakfast, “Pat” Murphy\r\nordered him to one of the superintendents, who questioned him as to his\r\nexperience in the work of the killing room.",
        "His heart began to thump\r\nwith excitement, for he divined instantly that his hour had come—that\r\nhe was to be a boss!",
        "Some of the foremen were union members, and many who were not had gone\r\nout with the men.",
        "It was in the killing department that the packers had\r\nbeen left most in the lurch, and precisely here that they could least\r\nafford it; the smoking and canning and salting of meat might wait, and\r\nall the by-products might be wasted—but fresh meats must be had, or the\r\nrestaurants and hotels and brownstone houses would feel the pinch, and\r\nthen “public opinion” would take a startling turn.",
        "An opportunity such as this would not come twice to a man; and Jurgis\r\nseized it.",
        "Yes, he knew the work, the whole of it, and he could teach\r\nit to others.",
        "But if he took the job and gave satisfaction he would\r\nexpect to keep it—they would not turn him off at the end of the strike?",
        "To which the superintendent replied that he might safely trust Durham’s\r\nfor that—they proposed to teach these unions a lesson, and most of all\r\nthose foremen who had gone back on them.",
        "Jurgis would receive five\r\ndollars a day during the strike, and twenty-five a week after it was\r\nsettled.",
        "So our friend got a pair of “slaughter pen” boots and “jeans,” and\r\nflung himself at his task.",
        "It was a weird sight, there on the killing\r\nbeds—a throng of stupid black Negroes, and foreigners who could not\r\nunderstand a word that was said to them, mixed with pale-faced,\r\nhollow-chested bookkeepers and clerks, half-fainting for the tropical\r\nheat and the sickening stench of fresh blood—and all struggling to\r\ndress a dozen or two cattle in the same place where, twenty-four hours\r\nago, the old killing gang had been speeding, with their marvelous\r\nprecision, turning out four hundred carcasses every hour!",
        "The Negroes and the “toughs” from the Lêvée did not want to work, and\r\nevery few minutes some of them would feel obliged to retire and\r\nrecuperate.",
        "In a couple of days Durham and Company had electric fans up\r\nto cool off the rooms for them, and even couches for them to rest on;\r\nand meantime they could go out and find a shady corner and take a\r\n“snooze,” and as there was no place for any one in particular, and no\r\nsystem, it might be hours before their boss discovered them.",
        "As for the\r\npoor office employees, they did their best, moved to it by terror;\r\nthirty of them had been “fired” in a bunch that first morning for\r\nrefusing to serve, besides a number of women clerks and typewriters who\r\nhad declined to act as waitresses.",
        "It was such a force as this that Jurgis had to organize.",
        "He did his\r\nbest, flying here and there, placing them in rows and showing them the\r\ntricks; he had never given an order in his life before, but he had\r\ntaken enough of them to know, and he soon fell into the spirit of it,\r\nand roared and stormed like any old stager.",
        "He had not the most\r\ntractable pupils, however.",
        "“See hyar, boss,” a big black “buck” would\r\nbegin, “ef you doan’ like de way Ah does dis job, you kin get somebody\r\nelse to do it.” Then a crowd would gather and listen, muttering\r\nthreats.",
        "After the first meal nearly all the steel knives had been\r\nmissing, and now every Negro had one, ground to a fine point, hidden in\r\nhis boots.",
        "There was no bringing order out of such a chaos, Jurgis soon\r\ndiscovered; and he fell in with the spirit of the thing—there was no\r\nreason why he should wear himself out with shouting.",
        "If hides and guts\r\nwere slashed and rendered useless there was no way of tracing it to any\r\none; and if a man lay off and forgot to come back there was nothing to\r\nbe gained by seeking him, for all the rest would quit in the meantime.",
        "Everything went, during the strike, and the packers paid.",
        "Before long\r\nJurgis found that the custom of resting had suggested to some alert\r\nminds the possibility of registering at more than one place and earning\r\nmore than one five dollars a day.",
        "When he caught a man at this he\r\n“fired” him, but it chanced to be in a quiet corner, and the man\r\ntendered him a ten-dollar bill and a wink, and he took them.",
        "Of course,\r\nbefore long this custom spread, and Jurgis was soon making quite a good\r\nincome from it.",
        "In the face of handicaps such as these the packers counted themselves\r\nlucky if they could kill off the cattle that had been crippled in\r\ntransit and the hogs that had developed disease.",
        "Frequently, in the\r\ncourse of a two or three days’ trip, in hot weather and without water,\r\nsome hog would develop cholera, and die; and the rest would attack him\r\nbefore he had ceased kicking, and when the car was opened there would\r\nbe nothing of him left but the bones.",
        "If all the hogs in this carload\r\nwere not killed at once, they would soon be down with the dread\r\ndisease, and there would be nothing to do but make them into lard.",
        "It\r\nwas the same with cattle that were gored and dying, or were limping\r\nwith broken bones stuck through their flesh—they must be killed, even\r\nif brokers and buyers and superintendents had to take off their coats\r\nand help drive and cut and skin them.",
        "And meantime, agents of the\r\npackers were gathering gangs of Negroes in the country districts of the\r\nfar South, promising them five dollars a day and board, and being\r\ncareful not to mention there was a strike; already carloads of them\r\nwere on the way, with special rates from the railroads, and all traffic\r\nordered out of the way.",
        "Many towns and cities were taking advantage of\r\nthe chance to clear out their jails and workhouses—in Detroit the\r\nmagistrates would release every man who agreed to leave town within\r\ntwenty-four hours, and agents of the packers were in the courtrooms to\r\nship them right.",
        "And meantime trainloads of supplies were coming in for\r\ntheir accommodation, including beer and whisky, so that they might not\r\nbe tempted to go outside.",
        "They hired thirty young girls in Cincinnati\r\nto “pack fruit,” and when they arrived put them at work canning corned\r\nbeef, and put cots for them to sleep in a public hallway, through which\r\nthe men passed.",
        "As the gangs came in day and night, under the escort of\r\nsquads of police, they stowed away in unused workrooms and storerooms,\r\nand in the car sheds, crowded so closely together that the cots\r\ntouched.",
        "In some places they would use the same room for eating and\r\nsleeping, and at night the men would put their cots upon the tables, to\r\nkeep away from the swarms of rats.",
        "But with all their best efforts, the packers were demoralized.",
        "Ninety\r\nper cent of the men had walked out; and they faced the task of\r\ncompletely remaking their labor force—and with the price of meat up\r\nthirty per cent, and the public clamoring for a settlement.",
        "They made\r\nan offer to submit the whole question at issue to arbitration; and at\r\nthe end of ten days the unions accepted it, and the strike was called\r\noff.",
        "It was agreed that all the men were to be re-employed within\r\nforty-five days, and that there was to be “no discrimination against\r\nunion men.”\r\n\r\nThis was an anxious time for Jurgis.",
        "If the men were taken back\r\n“without discrimination,” he would lose his present place.",
        "He sought\r\nout the superintendent, who smiled grimly and bade him “wait and see.”\r\nDurham’s strikebreakers were few of them leaving.",
        "Whether or not the “settlement” was simply a trick of the packers to\r\ngain time, or whether they really expected to break the strike and\r\ncripple the unions by the plan, cannot be said; but that night there\r\nwent out from the office of Durham and Company a telegram to all the\r\nbig packing centers, “Employ no union leaders.” And in the morning,\r\nwhen the twenty thousand men thronged into the yards, with their dinner\r\npails and working clothes, Jurgis stood near the door of the\r\nhog-trimming room, where he had worked before the strike, and saw a\r\nthrong of eager men, with a score or two of policemen watching them;\r\nand he saw a superintendent come out and walk down the line, and pick\r\nout man after man that pleased him; and one after another came, and\r\nthere were some men up near the head of the line who were never\r\npicked—they being the union stewards and delegates, and the men Jurgis\r\nhad heard making speeches at the meetings.",
        "Each time, of course, there\r\nwere louder murmurings and angrier looks.",
        "Over where the cattle\r\nbutchers were waiting, Jurgis heard shouts and saw a crowd, and he\r\nhurried there.",
        "One big butcher, who was president of the Packing Trades\r\nCouncil, had been passed over five times, and the men were wild with\r\nrage; they had appointed a committee of three to go in and see the\r\nsuperintendent, and the committee had made three attempts, and each\r\ntime the police had clubbed them back from the door.",
        "Then there were\r\nyells and hoots, continuing until at last the superintendent came to\r\nthe door.",
        "“We all go back or none of us do!” cried a hundred voices.",
        "And the other shook his fist at them, and shouted, “You went out of\r\nhere like cattle, and like cattle you’ll come back!”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the big butcher president leaped upon a pile of stones\r\nand yelled: “It’s off, boys.",
        "We’ll all of us quit again!” And so the\r\ncattle butchers declared a new strike on the spot; and gathering their\r\nmembers from the other plants, where the same trick had been played,\r\nthey marched down Packers’ Avenue, which was thronged with a dense mass\r\nof workers, cheering wildly.",
        "Men who had already got to work on the\r\nkilling beds dropped their tools and joined them; some galloped here\r\nand there on horseback, shouting the tidings, and within half an hour\r\nthe whole of Packingtown was on strike again, and beside itself with\r\nfury.",
        "There was quite a different tone in Packingtown after this—the place\r\nwas a seething caldron of passion, and the “scab” who ventured into it\r\nfared badly.",
        "There were one or two of these incidents each day, the\r\nnewspapers detailing them, and always blaming them upon the unions.",
        "Yet\r\nten years before, when there were no unions in Packingtown, there was a\r\nstrike, and national troops had to be called, and there were pitched\r\nbattles fought at night, by the light of blazing freight trains.",
        "Packingtown was always a center of violence; in “Whisky Point,” where\r\nthere were a hundred saloons and one glue factory, there was always\r\nfighting, and always more of it in hot weather.",
        "Any one who had taken\r\nthe trouble to consult the station house blotter would have found that\r\nthere was less violence that summer than ever before—and this while\r\ntwenty thousand men were out of work, and with nothing to do all day\r\nbut brood upon bitter wrongs.",
        "There was no one to picture the battle\r\nthe union leaders were fighting—to hold this huge army in rank, to keep\r\nit from straggling and pillaging, to cheer and encourage and guide a\r\nhundred thousand people, of a dozen different tongues, through six long\r\nweeks of hunger and disappointment and despair.",
        "Meantime the packers had set themselves definitely to the task of\r\nmaking a new labor force.",
        "A thousand or two of strikebreakers were\r\nbrought in every night, and distributed among the various plants.",
        "Some\r\nof them were experienced workers,—butchers, salesmen, and managers from\r\nthe packers’ branch stores, and a few union men who had deserted from\r\nother cities; but the vast majority were “green” Negroes from the\r\ncotton districts of the far South, and they were herded into the\r\npacking plants like sheep.",
        "There was a law forbidding the use of\r\nbuildings as lodginghouses unless they were licensed for the purpose,\r\nand provided with proper windows, stairways, and fire escapes; but\r\nhere, in a “paint room,” reached only by an enclosed “chute,” a room\r\nwithout a single window and only one door, a hundred men were crowded\r\nupon mattresses on the floor.",
        "Up on the third story of the “hog house”\r\nof Jones’s was a storeroom, without a window, into which they crowded\r\nseven hundred men, sleeping upon the bare springs of cots, and with a\r\nsecond shift to use them by day.",
        "And when the clamor of the public led\r\nto an investigation into these conditions, and the mayor of the city\r\nwas forced to order the enforcement of the law, the packers got a judge\r\nto issue an injunction forbidding him to do it!",
        "Just at this time the mayor was boasting that he had put an end to\r\ngambling and prize fighting in the city; but here a swarm of\r\nprofessional gamblers had leagued themselves with the police to fleece\r\nthe strikebreakers; and any night, in the big open space in front of\r\nBrown’s, one might see brawny Negroes stripped to the waist and\r\npounding each other for money, while a howling throng of three or four\r\nthousand surged about, men and women, young white girls from the\r\ncountry rubbing elbows with big buck Negroes with daggers in their\r\nboots, while rows of woolly heads peered down from every window of the\r\nsurrounding factories.",
        "The ancestors of these black people had been\r\nsavages in Africa; and since then they had been chattel slaves, or had\r\nbeen held down by a community ruled by the traditions of slavery.",
        "Now\r\nfor the first time they were free—free to gratify every passion, free\r\nto wreck themselves.",
        "They were wanted to break a strike, and when it\r\nwas broken they would be shipped away, and their present masters would\r\nnever see them again; and so whisky and women were brought in by the\r\ncarload and sold to them, and hell was let loose in the yards.",
        "Every\r\nnight there were stabbings and shootings; it was said that the packers\r\nhad blank permits, which enabled them to ship dead bodies from the city\r\nwithout troubling the authorities.",
        "They lodged men and women on the\r\nsame floor; and with the night there began a saturnalia of\r\ndebauchery—scenes such as never before had been witnessed in America.",
        "And as the women were the dregs from the brothels of Chicago, and the\r\nmen were for the most part ignorant country Negroes, the nameless\r\ndiseases of vice were soon rife; and this where food was being handled\r\nwhich was sent out to every corner of the civilized world.",
        "The “Union Stockyards” were never a pleasant place; but now they were\r\nnot only a collection of slaughterhouses, but also the camping place of\r\nan army of fifteen or twenty thousand human beasts.",
        "All day long the\r\nblazing midsummer sun beat down upon that square mile of abominations:\r\nupon tens of thousands of cattle crowded into pens whose wooden floors\r\nstank and steamed contagion; upon bare, blistering, cinder-strewn\r\nrailroad tracks, and huge blocks of dingy meat factories, whose\r\nlabyrinthine passages defied a breath of fresh air to penetrate them;\r\nand there were not merely rivers of hot blood, and car-loads of moist\r\nflesh, and rendering vats and soap caldrons, glue factories and\r\nfertilizer tanks, that smelt like the craters of hell—there were also\r\ntons of garbage festering in the sun, and the greasy laundry of the\r\nworkers hung out to dry, and dining rooms littered with food and black\r\nwith flies, and toilet rooms that were open sewers.",
        "And then at night, when this throng poured out into the streets to\r\nplay—fighting, gambling, drinking and carousing, cursing and screaming,\r\nlaughing and singing, playing banjoes and dancing!",
        "They were worked in\r\nthe yards all the seven days of the week, and they had their prize\r\nfights and crap games on Sunday nights as well; but then around the\r\ncorner one might see a bonfire blazing, and an old, gray-headed\r\nNegress, lean and witchlike, her hair flying wild and her eyes blazing,\r\nyelling and chanting of the fires of perdition and the blood of the\r\n“Lamb,” while men and women lay down upon the ground and moaned and\r\nscreamed in convulsions of terror and remorse.",
        "Such were the stockyards during the strike; while the unions watched in\r\nsullen despair, and the country clamored like a greedy child for its\r\nfood, and the packers went grimly on their way.",
        "Each day they added new\r\nworkers, and could be more stern with the old ones—could put them on\r\npiecework, and dismiss them if they did not keep up the pace.",
        "Jurgis\r\nwas now one of their agents in this process; and he could feel the\r\nchange day by day, like the slow starting up of a huge machine.",
        "He had\r\ngotten used to being a master of men; and because of the stifling heat\r\nand the stench, and the fact that he was a “scab” and knew it and\r\ndespised himself.",
        "He was drinking, and developing a villainous temper,\r\nand he stormed and cursed and raged at his men, and drove them until\r\nthey were ready to drop with exhaustion.",
        "Then one day late in August, a superintendent ran into the place and\r\nshouted to Jurgis and his gang to drop their work and come.",
        "They\r\nfollowed him outside, to where, in the midst of a dense throng, they\r\nsaw several two-horse trucks waiting, and three patrol-wagon loads of\r\npolice.",
        "Jurgis and his men sprang upon one of the trucks, and the\r\ndriver yelled to the crowd, and they went thundering away at a gallop.",
        "Some steers had just escaped from the yards, and the strikers had got\r\nhold of them, and there would be the chance of a scrap!",
        "They went out at the Ashland Avenue gate, and over in the direction of\r\nthe “dump.” There was a yell as soon as they were sighted, men and\r\nwomen rushing out of houses and saloons as they galloped by.",
        "There were\r\neight or ten policemen on the truck, however, and there was no\r\ndisturbance until they came to a place where the street was blocked\r\nwith a dense throng.",
        "Those on the flying truck yelled a warning and the\r\ncrowd scattered pell-mell, disclosing one of the steers lying in its\r\nblood.",
        "There were a good many cattle butchers about just then, with\r\nnothing much to do, and hungry children at home; and so some one had\r\nknocked out the steer—and as a first-class man can kill and dress one\r\nin a couple of minutes, there were a good many steaks and roasts\r\nalready missing.",
        "This called for punishment, of course; and the police\r\nproceeded to administer it by leaping from the truck and cracking at\r\nevery head they saw.",
        "There were yells of rage and pain, and the\r\nterrified people fled into houses and stores, or scattered\r\nhelter-skelter down the street.",
        "Jurgis and his gang joined in the\r\nsport, every man singling out his victim, and striving to bring him to\r\nbay and punch him.",
        "If he fled into a house his pursuer would smash in\r\nthe flimsy door and follow him up the stairs, hitting every one who\r\ncame within reach, and finally dragging his squealing quarry from under\r\na bed or a pile of old clothes in a closet.",
        "Jurgis and two policemen chased some men into a bar-room.",
        "One of them\r\ntook shelter behind the bar, where a policeman cornered him and\r\nproceeded to whack him over the back and shoulders, until he lay down\r\nand gave a chance at his head.",
        "The others leaped a fence in the rear,\r\nbalking the second policeman, who was fat; and as he came back, furious\r\nand cursing, a big Polish woman, the owner of the saloon, rushed in\r\nscreaming, and received a poke in the stomach that doubled her up on\r\nthe floor.",
        "Meantime Jurgis, who was of a practical temper, was helping\r\nhimself at the bar; and the first policeman, who had laid out his man,\r\njoined him, handing out several more bottles, and filling his pockets\r\nbesides, and then, as he started to leave, cleaning off all the balance\r\nwith a sweep of his club.",
        "The din of the glass crashing to the floor\r\nbrought the fat Polish woman to her feet again, but another policeman\r\ncame up behind her and put his knee into her back and his hands over\r\nher eyes—and then called to his companion, who went back and broke open\r\nthe cash drawer and filled his pockets with the contents.",
        "Then the\r\nthree went outside, and the man who was holding the woman gave her a\r\nshove and dashed out himself.",
        "The gang having already got the carcass\r\non to the truck, the party set out at a trot, followed by screams and\r\ncurses, and a shower of bricks and stones from unseen enemies.",
        "These\r\nbricks and stones would figure in the accounts of the “riot” which\r\nwould be sent out to a few thousand newspapers within an hour or two;\r\nbut the episode of the cash drawer would never be mentioned again, save\r\nonly in the heartbreaking legends of Packingtown.",
        "It was late in the afternoon when they got back, and they dressed out\r\nthe remainder of the steer, and a couple of others that had been\r\nkilled, and then knocked off for the day.",
        "Jurgis went downtown to\r\nsupper, with three friends who had been on the other trucks, and they\r\nexchanged reminiscences on the way.",
        "Afterward they drifted into a\r\nroulette parlor, and Jurgis, who was never lucky at gambling, dropped\r\nabout fifteen dollars.",
        "To console himself he had to drink a good deal,\r\nand he went back to Packingtown about two o’clock in the morning, very\r\nmuch the worse for his excursion, and, it must be confessed, entirely\r\ndeserving the calamity that was in store for him.",
        "As he was going to the place where he slept, he met a painted-cheeked\r\nwoman in a greasy “kimono,” and she put her arm about his waist to\r\nsteady him; they turned into a dark room they were passing—but scarcely\r\nhad they taken two steps before suddenly a door swung open, and a man\r\nentered, carrying a lantern.",
        "“Who’s there?” he called sharply.",
        "And\r\nJurgis started to mutter some reply; but at the same instant the man\r\nraised his light, which flashed in his face, so that it was possible to\r\nrecognize him.",
        "Jurgis stood stricken dumb, and his heart gave a leap\r\nlike a mad thing.",
        "The man was Connor!",
        "Connor, the boss of the loading gang!",
        "The man who had seduced his\r\nwife—who had sent him to prison, and wrecked his home, ruined his life!",
        "He stood there, staring, with the light shining full upon him.",
        "Jurgis had often thought of Connor since coming back to Packingtown,\r\nbut it had been as of something far off, that no longer concerned him.",
        "Now, however, when he saw him, alive and in the flesh, the same thing\r\nhappened to him that had happened before—a flood of rage boiled up in\r\nhim, a blind frenzy seized him.",
        "And he flung himself at the man, and\r\nsmote him between the eyes—and then, as he fell, seized him by the\r\nthroat and began to pound his head upon the stones.",
        "The woman began screaming, and people came rushing in.",
        "The lantern had\r\nbeen upset and extinguished, and it was so dark they could not see a\r\nthing; but they could hear Jurgis panting, and hear the thumping of his\r\nvictim’s skull, and they rushed there and tried to pull him off.",
        "Precisely as before, Jurgis came away with a piece of his enemy’s flesh\r\nbetween his teeth; and, as before, he went on fighting with those who\r\nhad interfered with him, until a policeman had come and beaten him into\r\ninsensibility.",
        "And so Jurgis spent the balance of the night in the stockyards station\r\nhouse.",
        "This time, however, he had money in his pocket, and when he came\r\nto his senses he could get something to drink, and also a messenger to\r\ntake word of his plight to “Bush” Harper.",
        "Harper did not appear,\r\nhowever, until after the prisoner, feeling very weak and ill, had been\r\nhailed into court and remanded at five hundred dollars’ bail to await\r\nthe result of his victim’s injuries.",
        "Jurgis was wild about this,\r\nbecause a different magistrate had chanced to be on the bench, and he\r\nhad stated that he had never been arrested before, and also that he had\r\nbeen attacked first—and if only someone had been there to speak a good\r\nword for him, he could have been let off at once.",
        "But Harper explained that he had been downtown, and had not got the\r\nmessage.",
        "“What’s happened to you?” he asked.",
        "“I’ve been doing a fellow up,” said Jurgis, “and I’ve got to get five\r\nhundred dollars’ bail.”\r\n\r\n“I can arrange that all right,” said the other—“though it may cost you\r\na few dollars, of course.",
        "But what was the trouble?”\r\n\r\n“It was a man that did me a mean trick once,” answered Jurgis.",
        "“Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“He’s a foreman in Brown’s or used to be.",
        "His name’s Connor.”\r\n\r\nAnd the other gave a start.",
        "“Connor!” he cried.",
        "“Not Phil Connor!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jurgis, “that’s the fellow.",
        "Why?”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” exclaimed the other, “then you’re in for it, old man!",
        "_I_\r\ncan’t help you!”\r\n\r\n“Not help me!",
        "Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Why, he’s one of Scully’s biggest men—he’s a member of the War-Whoop\r\nLeague, and they talked of sending him to the legislature!",
        "Phil Connor!",
        "Great heavens!”\r\n\r\nJurgis sat dumb with dismay.",
        "“Why, he can send you to Joliet, if he wants to!” declared the other.",
        "“Can’t I have Scully get me off before he finds out about it?” asked\r\nJurgis, at length.",
        "“But Scully’s out of town,” the other answered.",
        "“I don’t even know\r\nwhere he is—he’s run away to dodge the strike.”\r\n\r\nThat was a pretty mess, indeed.",
        "Poor Jurgis sat half-dazed.",
        "His pull\r\nhad run up against a bigger pull, and he was down and out!",
        "“But what am\r\nI going to do?” he asked, weakly.",
        "“How should I know?” said the other.",
        "“I shouldn’t even dare to get bail\r\nfor you—why, I might ruin myself for life!”\r\n\r\nAgain there was silence.",
        "“Can’t you do it for me,” Jurgis asked, “and\r\npretend that you didn’t know who I’d hit?”\r\n\r\n“But what good would that do you when you came to stand trial?” asked\r\nHarper.",
        "Then he sat buried in thought for a minute or two.",
        "“There’s\r\nnothing—unless it’s this,” he said.",
        "“I could have your bail reduced;\r\nand then if you had the money you could pay it and skip.”\r\n\r\n“How much will it be?” Jurgis asked, after he had had this explained\r\nmore in detail.",
        "“I don’t know,” said the other.",
        "“How much do you own?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got about three hundred dollars,” was the answer.",
        "“Well,” was Harper’s reply, “I’m not sure, but I’ll try and get you off\r\nfor that.",
        "I’ll take the risk for friendship’s sake—for I’d hate to see\r\nyou sent to state’s prison for a year or two.”\r\n\r\nAnd so finally Jurgis ripped out his bankbook—which was sewed up in his\r\ntrousers—and signed an order, which “Bush” Harper wrote, for all the\r\nmoney to be paid out.",
        "Then the latter went and got it, and hurried to\r\nthe court, and explained to the magistrate that Jurgis was a decent\r\nfellow and a friend of Scully’s, who had been attacked by a\r\nstrike-breaker.",
        "So the bail was reduced to three hundred dollars, and\r\nHarper went on it himself; he did not tell this to Jurgis, however—nor\r\ndid he tell him that when the time for trial came it would be an easy\r\nmatter for him to avoid the forfeiting of the bail, and pocket the\r\nthree hundred dollars as his reward for the risk of offending Mike\r\nScully!",
        "All that he told Jurgis was that he was now free, and that the\r\nbest thing he could do was to clear out as quickly as possible; and so\r\nJurgis overwhelmed with gratitude and relief, took the dollar and\r\nfourteen cents that was left him out of all his bank account, and put\r\nit with the two dollars and quarter that was left from his last night’s\r\ncelebration, and boarded a streetcar and got off at the other end of\r\nChicago.",
        "CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Jurgis was now an outcast and a tramp once more.",
        "He was\r\ncrippled—he was as literally crippled as any wild animal which has lost\r\nits claws, or been torn out of its shell.",
        "He had been shorn, at one\r\ncut, of all those mysterious weapons whereby he had been able to make a\r\nliving easily and to escape the consequences of his actions.",
        "He could\r\nno longer command a job when he wanted it; he could no longer steal\r\nwith impunity—he must take his chances with the common herd.",
        "Nay worse,\r\nhe dared not mingle with the herd—he must hide himself, for he was one\r\nmarked out for destruction.",
        "His old companions would betray him, for\r\nthe sake of the influence they would gain thereby; and he would be made\r\nto suffer, not merely for the offense he had committed, but for others\r\nwhich would be laid at his door, just as had been done for some poor\r\ndevil on the occasion of that assault upon the “country customer” by\r\nhim and Duane.",
        "And also he labored under another handicap now.",
        "He had acquired new\r\nstandards of living, which were not easily to be altered.",
        "When he had\r\nbeen out of work before, he had been content if he could sleep in a\r\ndoorway or under a truck out of the rain, and if he could get fifteen\r\ncents a day for saloon lunches.",
        "But now he desired all sorts of other\r\nthings, and suffered because he had to do without them.",
        "He must have a\r\ndrink now and then, a drink for its own sake, and apart from the food\r\nthat came with it.",
        "The craving for it was strong enough to master every\r\nother consideration—he would have it, though it were his last nickel\r\nand he had to starve the balance of the day in consequence.",
        "Jurgis became once more a besieger of factory gates.",
        "But never since he\r\nhad been in Chicago had he stood less chance of getting a job than just\r\nthen.",
        "For one thing, there was the economic crisis, the million or two\r\nof men who had been out of work in the spring and summer, and were not\r\nyet all back, by any means.",
        "And then there was the strike, with seventy\r\nthousand men and women all over the country idle for a couple of\r\nmonths—twenty thousand in Chicago, and many of them now seeking work\r\nthroughout the city.",
        "It did not remedy matters that a few days later\r\nthe strike was given up and about half the strikers went back to work;\r\nfor every one taken on, there was a “scab” who gave up and fled.",
        "The\r\nten or fifteen thousand “green” Negroes, foreigners, and criminals were\r\nnow being turned loose to shift for themselves.",
        "Everywhere Jurgis went\r\nhe kept meeting them, and he was in an agony of fear lest some one of\r\nthem should know that he was “wanted.” He would have left Chicago, only\r\nby the time he had realized his danger he was almost penniless; and it\r\nwould be better to go to jail than to be caught out in the country in\r\nthe winter time.",
        "At the end of about ten days Jurgis had only a few pennies left; and he\r\nhad not yet found a job—not even a day’s work at anything, not a chance\r\nto carry a satchel.",
        "Once again, as when he had come out of the\r\nhospital, he was bound hand and foot, and facing the grisly phantom of\r\nstarvation.",
        "Raw, naked terror possessed him, a maddening passion that\r\nwould never leave him, and that wore him down more quickly than the\r\nactual want of food.",
        "He was going to die of hunger!",
        "The fiend reached\r\nout its scaly arms for him—it touched him, its breath came into his\r\nface; and he would cry out for the awfulness of it, he would wake up in\r\nthe night, shuddering, and bathed in perspiration, and start up and\r\nflee.",
        "He would walk, begging for work, until he was exhausted; he could\r\nnot remain still—he would wander on, gaunt and haggard, gazing about\r\nhim with restless eyes.",
        "Everywhere he went, from one end of the vast\r\ncity to the other, there were hundreds of others like him; everywhere\r\nwas the sight of plenty and the merciless hand of authority waving them\r\naway.",
        "There is one kind of prison where the man is behind bars, and\r\neverything that he desires is outside; and there is another kind where\r\nthe things are behind the bars, and the man is outside.",
        "When he was down to his last quarter, Jurgis learned that before the\r\nbakeshops closed at night they sold out what was left at half price,\r\nand after that he would go and get two loaves of stale bread for a\r\nnickel, and break them up and stuff his pockets with them, munching a\r\nbit from time to time.",
        "He would not spend a penny save for this; and,\r\nafter two or three days more, he even became sparing of the bread, and\r\nwould stop and peer into the ash barrels as he walked along the\r\nstreets, and now and then rake out a bit of something, shake it free\r\nfrom dust, and count himself just so many minutes further from the end.",
        "So for several days he had been going about, ravenous all the time, and\r\ngrowing weaker and weaker, and then one morning he had a hideous\r\nexperience, that almost broke his heart.",
        "He was passing down a street\r\nlined with warehouses, and a boss offered him a job, and then, after he\r\nhad started to work, turned him off because he was not strong enough.",
        "And he stood by and saw another man put into his place, and then picked\r\nup his coat, and walked off, doing all that he could to keep from\r\nbreaking down and crying like a baby.",
        "He was lost!",
        "He was doomed!",
        "There\r\nwas no hope for him!",
        "But then, with a sudden rush, his fear gave place\r\nto rage.",
        "He fell to cursing.",
        "He would come back there after dark, and\r\nhe would show that scoundrel whether he was good for anything or not!",
        "He was still muttering this when suddenly, at the corner, he came upon\r\na green-grocery, with a tray full of cabbages in front of it.",
        "Jurgis,\r\nafter one swift glance about him, stooped and seized the biggest of\r\nthem, and darted round the corner with it.",
        "There was a hue and cry, and\r\na score of men and boys started in chase of him; but he came to an\r\nalley, and then to another branching off from it and leading him into\r\nanother street, where he fell into a walk, and slipped his cabbage\r\nunder his coat and went off unsuspected in the crowd.",
        "When he had\r\ngotten a safe distance away he sat down and devoured half the cabbage\r\nraw, stowing the balance away in his pockets till the next day.",
        "Just about this time one of the Chicago newspapers, which made much of\r\nthe “common people,” opened a “free-soup kitchen” for the benefit of\r\nthe unemployed.",
        "Some people said that they did this for the sake of the\r\nadvertising it gave them, and some others said that their motive was a\r\nfear lest all their readers should be starved off; but whatever the\r\nreason, the soup was thick and hot, and there was a bowl for every man,\r\nall night long.",
        "When Jurgis heard of this, from a fellow “hobo,” he\r\nvowed that he would have half a dozen bowls before morning; but, as it\r\nproved, he was lucky to get one, for there was a line of men two blocks\r\nlong before the stand, and there was just as long a line when the place\r\nwas finally closed up.",
        "This depot was within the danger line for Jurgis—in the “Lêvée”\r\ndistrict, where he was known; but he went there, all the same, for he\r\nwas desperate, and beginning to think of even the Bridewell as a place\r\nof refuge.",
        "So far the weather had been fair, and he had slept out every\r\nnight in a vacant lot; but now there fell suddenly a shadow of the\r\nadvancing winter, a chill wind from the north and a driving storm of\r\nrain.",
        "That day Jurgis bought two drinks for the sake of the shelter,\r\nand at night he spent his last two pennies in a “stale-beer dive.” This\r\nwas a place kept by a Negro, who went out and drew off the old dregs of\r\nbeer that lay in barrels set outside of the saloons; and after he had\r\ndoctored it with chemicals to make it “fizz,” he sold it for two cents\r\na can, the purchase of a can including the privilege of sleeping the\r\nnight through upon the floor, with a mass of degraded outcasts, men and\r\nwomen.",
        "All these horrors afflicted Jurgis all the more cruelly, because he was\r\nalways contrasting them with the opportunities he had lost.",
        "For\r\ninstance, just now it was election time again—within five or six weeks\r\nthe voters of the country would select a President; and he heard the\r\nwretches with whom he associated discussing it, and saw the streets of\r\nthe city decorated with placards and banners—and what words could\r\ndescribe the pangs of grief and despair that shot through him?",
        "For instance, there was a night during this cold spell.",
        "He had begged\r\nall day, for his very life, and found not a soul to heed him, until\r\ntoward evening he saw an old lady getting off a streetcar and helped\r\nher down with her umbrellas and bundles and then told her his\r\n“hard-luck story,” and after answering all her suspicious questions\r\nsatisfactorily, was taken to a restaurant and saw a quarter paid down\r\nfor a meal.",
        "And so he had soup and bread, and boiled beef and potatoes\r\nand beans, and pie and coffee, and came out with his skin stuffed tight\r\nas a football.",
        "And then, through the rain and the darkness, far down\r\nthe street he saw red lights flaring and heard the thumping of a bass\r\ndrum; and his heart gave a leap, and he made for the place on the\r\nrun—knowing without the asking that it meant a political meeting.",
        "The campaign had so far been characterized by what the newspapers\r\ntermed “apathy.” For some reason the people refused to get excited over\r\nthe struggle, and it was almost impossible to get them to come to\r\nmeetings, or to make any noise when they did come.",
        "Those which had been\r\nheld in Chicago so far had proven most dismal failures, and tonight,\r\nthe speaker being no less a personage than a candidate for the\r\nvice-presidency of the nation, the political managers had been\r\ntrembling with anxiety.",
        "But a merciful providence had sent this storm\r\nof cold rain—and now all it was necessary to do was to set off a few\r\nfireworks, and thump awhile on a drum, and all the homeless wretches\r\nfrom a mile around would pour in and fill the hall!",
        "And then on the\r\nmorrow the newspapers would have a chance to report the tremendous\r\novation, and to add that it had been no “silk-stocking” audience,\r\neither, proving clearly that the high tariff sentiments of the\r\ndistinguished candidate were pleasing to the wage-earners of the\r\nnation.",
        "So Jurgis found himself in a large hall, elaborately decorated with\r\nflags and bunting; and after the chairman had made his little speech,\r\nand the orator of the evening rose up, amid an uproar from the\r\nband—only fancy the emotions of Jurgis upon making the discovery that\r\nthe personage was none other than the famous and eloquent Senator\r\nSpareshanks, who had addressed the “Doyle Republican Association” at\r\nthe stockyards, and helped to elect Mike Scully’s tenpin setter to the\r\nChicago Board of Aldermen!",
        "In truth, the sight of the senator almost brought the tears into\r\nJurgis’s eyes.",
        "What agony it was to him to look back upon those golden\r\nhours, when he, too, had a place beneath the shadow of the plum tree!",
        "When he, too, had been of the elect, through whom the country is\r\ngoverned—when he had had a bung in the campaign barrel for his own!",
        "And\r\nthis was another election in which the Republicans had all the money;\r\nand but for that one hideous accident he might have had a share of it,\r\ninstead of being where he was!",
        "The eloquent senator was explaining the system of protection; an\r\ningenious device whereby the workingman permitted the manufacturer to\r\ncharge him higher prices, in order that he might receive higher wages;\r\nthus taking his money out of his pocket with one hand, and putting a\r\npart of it back with the other.",
        "To the senator this unique arrangement\r\nhad somehow become identified with the higher verities of the universe.",
        "It was because of it that Columbia was the gem of the ocean; and all\r\nher future triumphs, her power and good repute among the nations,\r\ndepended upon the zeal and fidelity with which each citizen held up the\r\nhands of those who were toiling to maintain it.",
        "The name of this heroic\r\ncompany was “the Grand Old Party”—\r\n\r\nAnd here the band began to play, and Jurgis sat up with a violent\r\nstart.",
        "Singular as it may seem, Jurgis was making a desperate effort to\r\nunderstand what the senator was saying—to comprehend the extent of\r\nAmerican prosperity, the enormous expansion of American commerce, and\r\nthe Republic’s future in the Pacific and in South America, and wherever\r\nelse the oppressed were groaning.",
        "The reason for it was that he wanted\r\nto keep awake.",
        "He knew that if he allowed himself to fall asleep he\r\nwould begin to snore loudly; and so he must listen—he must be\r\ninterested!",
        "But he had eaten such a big dinner, and he was so\r\nexhausted, and the hall was so warm, and his seat was so comfortable!",
        "The senator’s gaunt form began to grow dim and hazy, to tower before\r\nhim and dance about, with figures of exports and imports.",
        "Once his\r\nneighbor gave him a savage poke in the ribs, and he sat up with a start\r\nand tried to look innocent; but then he was at it again, and men began\r\nto stare at him with annoyance, and to call out in vexation.",
        "Finally\r\none of them called a policeman, who came and grabbed Jurgis by the\r\ncollar, and jerked him to his feet, bewildered and terrified.",
        "Some of\r\nthe audience turned to see the commotion, and Senator Spareshanks\r\nfaltered in his speech; but a voice shouted cheerily: “We’re just\r\nfiring a bum!",
        "Go ahead, old sport!” And so the crowd roared, and the\r\nsenator smiled genially, and went on; and in a few seconds poor Jurgis\r\nfound himself landed out in the rain, with a kick and a string of\r\ncurses.",
        "He got into the shelter of a doorway and took stock of himself.",
        "He was\r\nnot hurt, and he was not arrested—more than he had any right to expect.",
        "He swore at himself and his luck for a while, and then turned his\r\nthoughts to practical matters.",
        "He had no money, and no place to sleep;\r\nhe must begin begging again.",
        "He went out, hunching his shoulders together and shivering at the touch\r\nof the icy rain.",
        "Coming down the street toward him was a lady, well\r\ndressed, and protected by an umbrella; and he turned and walked beside\r\nher.",
        "“Please, ma’am,” he began, “could you lend me the price of a\r\nnight’s lodging?",
        "I’m a poor working-man—”\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, he stopped short.",
        "By the light of a street lamp he had\r\ncaught sight of the lady’s face.",
        "He knew her.",
        "It was Alena Jasaityte, who had been the belle of his wedding feast!",
        "Alena Jasaityte, who had looked so beautiful, and danced with such a\r\nqueenly air, with Juozas Raczius, the teamster!",
        "Jurgis had only seen\r\nher once or twice afterward, for Juozas had thrown her over for another\r\ngirl, and Alena had gone away from Packingtown, no one knew where.",
        "And\r\nnow he met her here!",
        "She was as much surprised as he was.",
        "“Jurgis Rudkus!” she gasped.",
        "“And\r\nwhat in the world is the matter with you?”\r\n\r\n“I—I’ve had hard luck,” he stammered.",
        "“I’m out of work, and I’ve no\r\nhome and no money.",
        "And you, Alena—are you married?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered, “I’m not married, but I’ve got a good place.”\r\n\r\nThey stood staring at each other for a few moments longer.",
        "Finally\r\nAlena spoke again.",
        "“Jurgis,” she said, “I’d help you if I could, upon\r\nmy word I would, but it happens that I’ve come out without my purse,\r\nand I honestly haven’t a penny with me: I can do something better for\r\nyou, though—I can tell you how to get help.",
        "I can tell you where Marija\r\nis.”\r\n\r\nJurgis gave a start.",
        "“Marija!” he exclaimed.",
        "“Yes,” said Alena; “and she’ll help you.",
        "She’s got a place, and she’s\r\ndoing well; she’ll be glad to see you.”\r\n\r\nIt was not much more than a year since Jurgis had left Packingtown,\r\nfeeling like one escaped from jail; and it had been from Marija and\r\nElzbieta that he was escaping.",
        "But now, at the mere mention of them,\r\nhis whole being cried out with joy.",
        "He wanted to see them; he wanted to\r\ngo home!",
        "They would help him—they would be kind to him.",
        "In a flash he\r\nhad thought over the situation.",
        "He had a good excuse for running\r\naway—his grief at the death of his son; and also he had a good excuse\r\nfor not returning—the fact that they had left Packingtown.",
        "“All right,”\r\nhe said, “I’ll go.”\r\n\r\nSo she gave him a number on Clark Street, adding, “There’s no need to\r\ngive you my address, because Marija knows it.” And Jurgis set out,\r\nwithout further ado.",
        "He found a large brownstone house of aristocratic\r\nappearance, and rang the basement bell.",
        "A young colored girl came to\r\nthe door, opening it about an inch, and gazing at him suspiciously.",
        "“What do you want?” she demanded.",
        "“Does Marija Berczynskas live here?” he inquired.",
        "“I dunno,” said the girl.",
        "“What you want wid her?”\r\n\r\n“I want to see her,” said he; “she’s a relative of mine.”\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated a moment.",
        "Then she opened the door and said, “Come\r\nin.” Jurgis came and stood in the hall, and she continued: “I’ll go\r\nsee.",
        "What’s yo’ name?”\r\n\r\n“Tell her it’s Jurgis,” he answered, and the girl went upstairs.",
        "She\r\ncame back at the end of a minute or two, and replied, “Dey ain’t no\r\nsich person here.”\r\n\r\nJurgis’s heart went down into his boots.",
        "“I was told this was where she\r\nlived!” he cried.",
        "But the girl only shook her head.",
        "“De lady says dey\r\nain’t no sich person here,” she said.",
        "And he stood for a moment, hesitating, helpless with dismay.",
        "Then he\r\nturned to go to the door.",
        "At the same instant, however, there came a\r\nknock upon it, and the girl went to open it.",
        "Jurgis heard the shuffling\r\nof feet, and then heard her give a cry; and the next moment she sprang\r\nback, and past him, her eyes shining white with terror, and bounded up\r\nthe stairway, screaming at the top of her lungs: “_Police!",
        "Police!",
        "We’re pinched!_”\r\n\r\nJurgis stood for a second, bewildered.",
        "Then, seeing blue-coated forms\r\nrushing upon him, he sprang after the Negress.",
        "Her cries had been the\r\nsignal for a wild uproar above; the house was full of people, and as he\r\nentered the hallway he saw them rushing hither and thither, crying and\r\nscreaming with alarm.",
        "There were men and women, the latter clad for the\r\nmost part in wrappers, the former in all stages of _déshabille_.",
        "At one\r\nside Jurgis caught a glimpse of a big apartment with plush-covered\r\nchairs, and tables covered with trays and glasses.",
        "There were playing\r\ncards scattered all over the floor—one of the tables had been upset,\r\nand bottles of wine were rolling about, their contents running out upon\r\nthe carpet.",
        "There was a young girl who had fainted, and two men who\r\nwere supporting her; and there were a dozen others crowding toward the\r\nfront door.",
        "Suddenly, however, there came a series of resounding blows upon it,\r\ncausing the crowd to give back.",
        "At the same instant a stout woman, with\r\npainted cheeks and diamonds in her ears, came running down the stairs,\r\npanting breathlessly: “To the rear!",
        "Quick!”\r\n\r\nShe led the way to a back staircase, Jurgis following; in the kitchen\r\nshe pressed a spring, and a cupboard gave way and opened, disclosing a\r\ndark passageway.",
        "“Go in!” she cried to the crowd, which now amounted to\r\ntwenty or thirty, and they began to pass through.",
        "Scarcely had the last\r\none disappeared, however, before there were cries from in front, and\r\nthen the panic-stricken throng poured out again, exclaiming: “They’re\r\nthere too!",
        "We’re trapped!”\r\n\r\n“Upstairs!” cried the woman, and there was another rush of the mob,\r\nwomen and men cursing and screaming and fighting to be first.",
        "One\r\nflight, two, three—and then there was a ladder to the roof, with a\r\ncrowd packed at the foot of it, and one man at the top, straining and\r\nstruggling to lift the trap door.",
        "It was not to be stirred, however,\r\nand when the woman shouted up to unhook it, he answered: “It’s already\r\nunhooked.",
        "There’s somebody sitting on it!”\r\n\r\nAnd a moment later came a voice from downstairs: “You might as well\r\nquit, you people.",
        "We mean business, this time.”\r\n\r\nSo the crowd subsided; and a few moments later several policemen came\r\nup, staring here and there, and leering at their victims.",
        "Of the latter\r\nthe men were for the most part frightened and sheepish-looking.",
        "The\r\nwomen took it as a joke, as if they were used to it—though if they had\r\nbeen pale, one could not have told, for the paint on their cheeks.",
        "One\r\nblack-eyed young girl perched herself upon the top of the balustrade,\r\nand began to kick with her slippered foot at the helmets of the\r\npolicemen, until one of them caught her by the ankle and pulled her\r\ndown.",
        "On the floor below four or five other girls sat upon trunks in\r\nthe hall, making fun of the procession which filed by them.",
        "They were\r\nnoisy and hilarious, and had evidently been drinking; one of them, who\r\nwore a bright red kimono, shouted and screamed in a voice that drowned\r\nout all the other sounds in the hall—and Jurgis took a glance at her,\r\nand then gave a start, and a cry, “Marija!”\r\n\r\nShe heard him, and glanced around; then she shrank back and half sprang\r\nto her feet in amazement.",
        "“Jurgis!” she gasped.",
        "For a second or two they stood staring at each other.",
        "“How did you come\r\nhere?” Marija exclaimed.",
        "“I came to see you,” he answered.",
        "“When?”\r\n\r\n“Just now.”\r\n\r\n“But how did you know—who told you I was here?”\r\n\r\n“Alena Jasaityte.",
        "I met her on the street.”\r\n\r\nAgain there was a silence, while they gazed at each other.",
        "The rest of\r\nthe crowd was watching them, and so Marija got up and came closer to\r\nhim.",
        "“And you?” Jurgis asked.",
        "“You live here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Marija, “I live here.” Then suddenly came a hail from\r\nbelow: “Get your clothes on now, girls, and come along.",
        "You’d best\r\nbegin, or you’ll be sorry—it’s raining outside.”\r\n\r\n“Br-r-r!” shivered some one, and the women got up and entered the\r\nvarious doors which lined the hallway.",
        "“Come,” said Marija, and took Jurgis into her room, which was a tiny\r\nplace about eight by six, with a cot and a chair and a dressing stand\r\nand some dresses hanging behind the door.",
        "There were clothes scattered\r\nabout on the floor, and hopeless confusion everywhere—boxes of rouge\r\nand bottles of perfume mixed with hats and soiled dishes on the\r\ndresser, and a pair of slippers and a clock and a whisky bottle on a\r\nchair.",
        "Marija had nothing on but a kimono and a pair of stockings; yet she\r\nproceeded to dress before Jurgis, and without even taking the trouble\r\nto close the door.",
        "He had by this time divined what sort of a place he\r\nwas in; and he had seen a great deal of the world since he had left\r\nhome, and was not easy to shock—and yet it gave him a painful start\r\nthat Marija should do this.",
        "They had always been decent people at home,\r\nand it seemed to him that the memory of old times ought to have ruled\r\nher.",
        "But then he laughed at himself for a fool.",
        "What was he, to be\r\npretending to decency!",
        "“How long have you been living here?” he asked.",
        "“Nearly a year,” she answered.",
        "“Why did you come?”\r\n\r\n“I had to live,” she said; “and I couldn’t see the children starve.”\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment, watching her.",
        "“You were out of work?” he asked,\r\nfinally.",
        "“I got sick,” she replied, “and after that I had no money.",
        "And then\r\nStanislovas died—”\r\n\r\n“Stanislovas dead!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Marija, “I forgot.",
        "You didn’t know about it.”\r\n\r\n“How did he die?”\r\n\r\n“Rats killed him,” she answered.",
        "Jurgis gave a gasp.",
        "“_Rats_ killed him!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the other; she was bending over, lacing her shoes as she\r\nspoke.",
        "“He was working in an oil factory—at least he was hired by the\r\nmen to get their beer.",
        "He used to carry cans on a long pole; and he’d\r\ndrink a little out of each can, and one day he drank too much, and fell\r\nasleep in a corner, and got locked up in the place all night.",
        "When they\r\nfound him the rats had killed him and eaten him nearly all up.”\r\n\r\nJurgis sat, frozen with horror.",
        "Marija went on lacing up her shoes.",
        "There was a long silence.",
        "Suddenly a big policeman came to the door.",
        "“Hurry up, there,” he said.",
        "“As quick as I can,” said Marija, and she stood up and began putting on\r\nher corsets with feverish haste.",
        "“Are the rest of the people alive?” asked Jurgis, finally.",
        "“Yes,” she said.",
        "“Where are they?”\r\n\r\n“They live not far from here.",
        "They’re all right now.”\r\n\r\n“They are working?” he inquired.",
        "“Elzbieta is,” said Marija, “when she can.",
        "I take care of them most of\r\nthe time—I’m making plenty of money now.”\r\n\r\nJurgis was silent for a moment.",
        "“Do they know you live here—how you\r\nlive?” he asked.",
        "“Elzbieta knows,” answered Marija.",
        "“I couldn’t lie to her.",
        "And maybe\r\nthe children have found out by this time.",
        "It’s nothing to be ashamed\r\nof—we can’t help it.”\r\n\r\n“And Tamoszius?” he asked.",
        "“Does _he_ know?”\r\n\r\nMarija shrugged her shoulders.",
        "“How do I know?” she said.",
        "“I haven’t\r\nseen him for over a year.",
        "He got blood poisoning and lost one finger,\r\nand couldn’t play the violin any more; and then he went away.”\r\n\r\nMarija was standing in front of the glass fastening her dress.",
        "Jurgis\r\nsat staring at her.",
        "He could hardly believe that she was the same woman\r\nhe had known in the old days; she was so quiet—so hard!",
        "It struck fear\r\nto his heart to watch her.",
        "Then suddenly she gave a glance at him.",
        "“You look as if you had been\r\nhaving a rough time of it yourself,” she said.",
        "“I have,” he answered.",
        "“I haven’t a cent in my pockets, and nothing to\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\n“Where have you been?”\r\n\r\n“All over.",
        "I’ve been hoboing it.",
        "Then I went back to the yards—just\r\nbefore the strike.” He paused for a moment, hesitating.",
        "“I asked for\r\nyou,” he added.",
        "“I found you had gone away, no one knew where.",
        "Perhaps\r\nyou think I did you a dirty trick running away as I did, Marija—”\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered, “I don’t blame you.",
        "We never have—any of us.",
        "You\r\ndid your best—the job was too much for us.” She paused a moment, then\r\nadded: “We were too ignorant—that was the trouble.",
        "We didn’t stand any\r\nchance.",
        "If I’d known what I know now we’d have won out.”\r\n\r\n“You’d have come here?” said Jurgis.",
        "“Yes,” she answered; “but that’s not what I meant.",
        "I meant you—how\r\ndifferently you would have behaved—about Ona.”\r\n\r\nJurgis was silent; he had never thought of that aspect of it.",
        "“When people are starving,” the other continued, “and they have\r\nanything with a price, they ought to sell it, I say.",
        "I guess you\r\nrealize it now when it’s too late.",
        "Ona could have taken care of us all,\r\nin the beginning.” Marija spoke without emotion, as one who had come to\r\nregard things from the business point of view.",
        "“I—yes, I guess so,” Jurgis answered hesitatingly.",
        "He did not add that\r\nhe had paid three hundred dollars, and a foreman’s job, for the\r\nsatisfaction of knocking down “Phil” Connor a second time.",
        "The policeman came to the door again just then.",
        "“Come on, now,” he\r\nsaid.",
        "“Lively!”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Marija, reaching for her hat, which was big enough to\r\nbe a drum major’s, and full of ostrich feathers.",
        "She went out into the\r\nhall and Jurgis followed, the policeman remaining to look under the bed\r\nand behind the door.",
        "“What’s going to come of this?” Jurgis asked, as they started down the\r\nsteps.",
        "“The raid, you mean?",
        "Oh, nothing—it happens to us every now and then.",
        "The madame’s having some sort of time with the police; I don’t know\r\nwhat it is, but maybe they’ll come to terms before morning.",
        "Anyhow,\r\nthey won’t do anything to you.",
        "They always let the men off.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe so,” he responded, “but not me—I’m afraid I’m in for it.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I’m wanted by the police,” he said, lowering his voice, though of\r\ncourse their conversation was in Lithuanian.",
        "“They’ll send me up for a\r\nyear or two, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Hell!” said Marija.",
        "“That’s too bad.",
        "I’ll see if I can’t get you off.”\r\n\r\nDownstairs, where the greater part of the prisoners were now massed,\r\nshe sought out the stout personage with the diamond earrings, and had a\r\nfew whispered words with her.",
        "The latter then approached the police\r\nsergeant who was in charge of the raid.",
        "“Billy,” she said, pointing to\r\nJurgis, “there’s a fellow who came in to see his sister.",
        "He’d just got\r\nin the door when you knocked.",
        "You aren’t taking hoboes, are you?”\r\n\r\nThe sergeant laughed as he looked at Jurgis.",
        "“Sorry,” he said, “but the\r\norders are every one but the servants.”\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis slunk in among the rest of the men, who kept dodging behind\r\neach other like sheep that have smelled a wolf.",
        "There were old men and\r\nyoung men, college boys and gray-beards old enough to be their\r\ngrandfathers; some of them wore evening dress—there was no one among\r\nthem save Jurgis who showed any signs of poverty.",
        "When the roundup was completed, the doors were opened and the party\r\nmarched out.",
        "Three patrol wagons were drawn up at the curb, and the\r\nwhole neighborhood had turned out to see the sport; there was much\r\nchaffing, and a universal craning of necks.",
        "The women stared about them\r\nwith defiant eyes, or laughed and joked, while the men kept their heads\r\nbowed, and their hats pulled over their faces.",
        "They were crowded into\r\nthe patrol wagons as if into streetcars, and then off they went amid a\r\ndin of cheers.",
        "At the station house Jurgis gave a Polish name and was\r\nput into a cell with half a dozen others; and while these sat and\r\ntalked in whispers, he lay down in a corner and gave himself up to his\r\nthoughts.",
        "Jurgis had looked into the deepest reaches of the social pit, and grown\r\nused to the sights in them.",
        "Yet when he had thought of all humanity as\r\nvile and hideous, he had somehow always excepted his own family that he\r\nhad loved; and now this sudden horrible discovery—Marija a whore, and\r\nElzbieta and the children living off her shame!",
        "Jurgis might argue with\r\nhimself all he chose, that he had done worse, and was a fool for\r\ncaring—but still he could not get over the shock of that sudden\r\nunveiling, he could not help being sunk in grief because of it.",
        "The\r\ndepths of him were troubled and shaken, memories were stirred in him\r\nthat had been sleeping so long he had counted them dead.",
        "Memories of\r\nthe old life—his old hopes and his old yearnings, his old dreams of\r\ndecency and independence!",
        "He saw Ona again, he heard her gentle voice\r\npleading with him.",
        "He saw little Antanas, whom he had meant to make a\r\nman.",
        "He saw his trembling old father, who had blessed them all with his\r\nwonderful love.",
        "He lived again through that day of horror when he had\r\ndiscovered Ona’s shame—God, how he had suffered, what a madman he had\r\nbeen!",
        "How dreadful it had all seemed to him; and now, today, he had sat\r\nand listened, and half agreed when Marija told him he had been a fool!",
        "Yes—told him that he ought to have sold his wife’s honor and lived by\r\nit!—And then there was Stanislovas and his awful fate—that brief story\r\nwhich Marija had narrated so calmly, with such dull indifference!",
        "The\r\npoor little fellow, with his frostbitten fingers and his terror of the\r\nsnow—his wailing voice rang in Jurgis’s ears, as he lay there in the\r\ndarkness, until the sweat started on his forehead.",
        "Now and then he\r\nwould quiver with a sudden spasm of horror, at the picture of little\r\nStanislovas shut up in the deserted building and fighting for his life\r\nwith the rats!",
        "All these emotions had become strangers to the soul of Jurgis; it was\r\nso long since they had troubled him that he had ceased to think they\r\nmight ever trouble him again.",
        "Helpless, trapped, as he was, what good\r\ndid they do him—why should he ever have allowed them to torment him?",
        "It\r\nhad been the task of his recent life to fight them down, to crush them\r\nout of him; never in his life would he have suffered from them again,\r\nsave that they had caught him unawares, and overwhelmed him before he\r\ncould protect himself.",
        "He heard the old voices of his soul, he saw its\r\nold ghosts beckoning to him, stretching out their arms to him!",
        "But they\r\nwere far-off and shadowy, and the gulf between them was black and\r\nbottomless; they would fade away into the mists of the past once more.",
        "Their voices would die, and never again would he hear them—and so the\r\nlast faint spark of manhood in his soul would flicker out.",
        "CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Jurgis was driven to the court, which was crowded with\r\nthe prisoners and those who had come out of curiosity or in the hope of\r\nrecognizing one of the men and getting a case for blackmail.",
        "The men\r\nwere called up first, and reprimanded in a bunch, and then dismissed;\r\nbut, Jurgis, to his terror, was called separately, as being a\r\nsuspicious-looking case.",
        "It was in this very same court that he had\r\nbeen tried, that time when his sentence had been “suspended”; it was\r\nthe same judge, and the same clerk.",
        "The latter now stared at Jurgis, as\r\nif he half thought that he knew him; but the judge had no\r\nsuspicions—just then his thoughts were upon a telephone message he was\r\nexpecting from a friend of the police captain of the district, telling\r\nwhat disposition he should make of the case of “Polly” Simpson, as the\r\n“madame” of the house was known.",
        "Meantime, he listened to the story of\r\nhow Jurgis had been looking for his sister, and advised him dryly to\r\nkeep his sister in a better place; then he let him go, and proceeded to\r\nfine each of the girls five dollars, which fines were paid in a bunch\r\nfrom a wad of bills which Madame Polly extracted from her stocking.",
        "Jurgis waited outside and walked home with Marija.",
        "The police had left\r\nthe house, and already there were a few visitors; by evening the place\r\nwould be running again, exactly as if nothing had happened.",
        "Meantime,\r\nMarija took Jurgis upstairs to her room, and they sat and talked.",
        "By\r\ndaylight, Jurgis was able to observe that the color on her cheeks was\r\nnot the old natural one of abounding health; her complexion was in\r\nreality a parchment yellow, and there were black rings under her eyes.",
        "“Have you been sick?” he asked.",
        "“Sick?” she said.",
        "“Hell!” (Marija had learned to scatter her\r\nconversation with as many oaths as a longshoreman or a mule driver.)\r\n“How can I ever be anything but sick, at this life?”\r\n\r\nShe fell silent for a moment, staring ahead of her gloomily.",
        "“It’s\r\nmorphine,” she said, at last.",
        "“I seem to take more of it every day.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that for?” he asked.",
        "“It’s the way of it; I don’t know why.",
        "If it isn’t that, it’s drink.",
        "If\r\nthe girls didn’t booze they couldn’t stand it any time at all.",
        "And the\r\nmadame always gives them dope when they first come, and they learn to\r\nlike it; or else they take it for headaches and such things, and get\r\nthe habit that way.",
        "I’ve got it, I know; I’ve tried to quit, but I\r\nnever will while I’m here.”\r\n\r\n“How long are you going to stay?” he asked.",
        "“I don’t know,” she said.",
        "“Always, I guess.",
        "What else could I do?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you save any money?”\r\n\r\n“Save!” said Marija.",
        "“Good Lord, no!",
        "I get enough, I suppose, but it\r\nall goes.",
        "I get a half share, two dollars and a half for each customer,\r\nand sometimes I make twenty-five or thirty dollars a night, and you’d\r\nthink I ought to save something out of that!",
        "But then I am charged for\r\nmy room and my meals—and such prices as you never heard of; and then\r\nfor extras, and drinks—for everything I get, and some I don’t.",
        "My\r\nlaundry bill is nearly twenty dollars each week alone—think of that!",
        "Yet what can I do?",
        "I either have to stand it or quit, and it would be\r\nthe same anywhere else.",
        "It’s all I can do to save the fifteen dollars I\r\ngive Elzbieta each week, so the children can go to school.”\r\n\r\nMarija sat brooding in silence for a while; then, seeing that Jurgis\r\nwas interested, she went on: “That’s the way they keep the girls—they\r\nlet them run up debts, so they can’t get away.",
        "A young girl comes from\r\nabroad, and she doesn’t know a word of English, and she gets into a\r\nplace like this, and when she wants to go the madame shows her that she\r\nis a couple of hundred dollars in debt, and takes all her clothes away,\r\nand threatens to have her arrested if she doesn’t stay and do as she’s\r\ntold.",
        "So she stays, and the longer she stays, the more in debt she\r\ngets.",
        "Often, too, they are girls that didn’t know what they were coming\r\nto, that had hired out for housework.",
        "Did you notice that little French\r\ngirl with the yellow hair, that stood next to me in the court?”\r\n\r\nJurgis answered in the affirmative.",
        "“Well, she came to America about a year ago.",
        "She was a store clerk, and\r\nshe hired herself to a man to be sent here to work in a factory.",
        "There\r\nwere six of them, all together, and they were brought to a house just\r\ndown the street from here, and this girl was put into a room alone, and\r\nthey gave her some dope in her food, and when she came to she found\r\nthat she had been ruined.",
        "She cried, and screamed, and tore her hair,\r\nbut she had nothing but a wrapper, and couldn’t get away, and they kept\r\nher half insensible with drugs all the time, until she gave up.",
        "She\r\nnever got outside of that place for ten months, and then they sent her\r\naway, because she didn’t suit.",
        "I guess they’ll put her out of here,\r\ntoo—she’s getting to have crazy fits, from drinking absinthe.",
        "Only one\r\nof the girls that came out with her got away, and she jumped out of a\r\nsecond-story window one night.",
        "There was a great fuss about that—maybe\r\nyou heard of it.”\r\n\r\n“I did,” said Jurgis, “I heard of it afterward.” (It had happened in\r\nthe place where he and Duane had taken refuge from their “country\r\ncustomer.” The girl had become insane, fortunately for the police.)\r\n\r\n“There’s lots of money in it,” said Marija—“they get as much as forty\r\ndollars a head for girls, and they bring them from all over.",
        "There are\r\nseventeen in this place, and nine different countries among them.",
        "In\r\nsome places you might find even more.",
        "We have half a dozen French\r\ngirls—I suppose it’s because the madame speaks the language.",
        "French\r\ngirls are bad, too, the worst of all, except for the Japanese.",
        "There’s\r\na place next door that’s full of Japanese women, but I wouldn’t live in\r\nthe same house with one of them.”\r\n\r\nMarija paused for a moment or two, and then she added: “Most of the\r\nwomen here are pretty decent—you’d be surprised.",
        "I used to think they\r\ndid it because they liked to; but fancy a woman selling herself to\r\nevery kind of man that comes, old or young, black or white—and doing it\r\nbecause she likes to!”\r\n\r\n“Some of them say they do,” said Jurgis.",
        "“I know,” said she; “they say anything.",
        "They’re in, and they know they\r\ncan’t get out.",
        "But they didn’t like it when they began—you’d find\r\nout—it’s always misery!",
        "There’s a little Jewish girl here who used to\r\nrun errands for a milliner, and got sick and lost her place; and she\r\nwas four days on the streets without a mouthful of food, and then she\r\nwent to a place just around the corner and offered herself, and they\r\nmade her give up her clothes before they would give her a bite to eat!”\r\n\r\nMarija sat for a minute or two, brooding somberly.",
        "“Tell me about\r\nyourself, Jurgis,” she said, suddenly.",
        "“Where have you been?”\r\n\r\nSo he told her the long story of his adventures since his flight from\r\nhome; his life as a tramp, and his work in the freight tunnels, and the\r\naccident; and then of Jack Duane, and of his political career in the\r\nstockyards, and his downfall and subsequent failures.",
        "Marija listened\r\nwith sympathy; it was easy to believe the tale of his late starvation,\r\nfor his face showed it all.",
        "“You found me just in the nick of time,”\r\nshe said.",
        "“I’ll stand by you—I’ll help you till you can get some work.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like to let you—” he began.",
        "“Why not?",
        "Because I’m here?”\r\n\r\n“No, not that,” he said.",
        "“But I went off and left you—”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Marija.",
        "“Don’t think about it.",
        "I don’t blame you.”\r\n\r\n“You must be hungry,” she said, after a minute or two.",
        "“You stay here\r\nto lunch—I’ll have something up in the room.”\r\n\r\nShe pressed a button, and a colored woman came to the door and took her\r\norder.",
        "“It’s nice to have somebody to wait on you,” she observed, with\r\na laugh, as she lay back on the bed.",
        "As the prison breakfast had not been liberal, Jurgis had a good\r\nappetite, and they had a little feast together, talking meanwhile of\r\nElzbieta and the children and old times.",
        "Shortly before they were\r\nthrough, there came another colored girl, with the message that the\r\n“madame” wanted Marija—“Lithuanian Mary,” as they called her here.",
        "“That means you have to go,” she said to Jurgis.",
        "So he got up, and she gave him the new address of the family, a\r\ntenement over in the Ghetto district.",
        "“You go there,” she said.",
        "“They’ll be glad to see you.”\r\n\r\nBut Jurgis stood hesitating.",
        "“I—I don’t like to,” he said.",
        "“Honest, Marija, why don’t you just give\r\nme a little money and let me look for work first?”\r\n\r\n“How do you need money?” was her reply.",
        "“All you want is something to\r\neat and a place to sleep, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said; “but then I don’t like to go there after I left\r\nthem—and while I have nothing to do, and while you—you—”\r\n\r\n“Go on!” said Marija, giving him a push.",
        "“What are you talking?—I won’t\r\ngive you money,” she added, as she followed him to the door, “because\r\nyou’ll drink it up, and do yourself harm.",
        "Here’s a quarter for you now,\r\nand go along, and they’ll be so glad to have you back, you won’t have\r\ntime to feel ashamed.",
        "Good-by!”\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis went out, and walked down the street to think it over.",
        "He\r\ndecided that he would first try to get work, and so he put in the rest\r\nof the day wandering here and there among factories and warehouses\r\nwithout success.",
        "Then, when it was nearly dark, he concluded to go\r\nhome, and set out; but he came to a restaurant, and went in and spent\r\nhis quarter for a meal; and when he came out he changed his mind—the\r\nnight was pleasant, and he would sleep somewhere outside, and put in\r\nthe morrow hunting, and so have one more chance of a job.",
        "So he started\r\naway again, when suddenly he chanced to look about him, and found that\r\nhe was walking down the same street and past the same hall where he had\r\nlistened to the political speech the night before.",
        "There was no red\r\nfire and no band now, but there was a sign out, announcing a meeting,\r\nand a stream of people pouring in through the entrance.",
        "In a flash\r\nJurgis had decided that he would chance it once more, and sit down and\r\nrest while making up his mind what to do.",
        "There was no one taking\r\ntickets, so it must be a free show again.",
        "He entered.",
        "There were no decorations in the hall this time; but there\r\nwas quite a crowd upon the platform, and almost every seat in the place\r\nwas filled.",
        "He took one of the last, far in the rear, and straightway\r\nforgot all about his surroundings.",
        "Would Elzbieta think that he had\r\ncome to sponge off her, or would she understand that he meant to get to\r\nwork again and do his share?",
        "Would she be decent to him, or would she\r\nscold him?",
        "If only he could get some sort of a job before he went—if\r\nthat last boss had only been willing to try him!",
        "—Then suddenly Jurgis looked up.",
        "A tremendous roar had burst from the\r\nthroats of the crowd, which by this time had packed the hall to the\r\nvery doors.",
        "Men and women were standing up, waving handkerchiefs,\r\nshouting, yelling.",
        "Evidently the speaker had arrived, thought Jurgis;\r\nwhat fools they were making of themselves!",
        "What were they expecting to\r\nget out of it anyhow—what had they to do with elections, with governing\r\nthe country?",
        "Jurgis had been behind the scenes in politics.",
        "He went back to his thoughts, but with one further fact to reckon\r\nwith—that he was caught here.",
        "The hall was now filled to the doors; and\r\nafter the meeting it would be too late for him to go home, so he would\r\nhave to make the best of it outside.",
        "Perhaps it would be better to go\r\nhome in the morning, anyway, for the children would be at school, and\r\nhe and Elzbieta could have a quiet explanation.",
        "She always had been a\r\nreasonable person; and he really did mean to do right.",
        "He would manage\r\nto persuade her of it—and besides, Marija was willing, and Marija was\r\nfurnishing the money.",
        "If Elzbieta were ugly, he would tell her that in\r\nso many words.",
        "So Jurgis went on meditating; until finally, when he had been an hour\r\nor two in the hall, there began to prepare itself a repetition of the\r\ndismal catastrophe of the night before.",
        "Speaking had been going on all\r\nthe time, and the audience was clapping its hands and shouting,\r\nthrilling with excitement; and little by little the sounds were\r\nbeginning to blur in Jurgis’s ears, and his thoughts were beginning to\r\nrun together, and his head to wobble and nod.",
        "He caught himself many\r\ntimes, as usual, and made desperate resolutions; but the hall was hot\r\nand close, and his long walk and his dinner were too much for him—in\r\nthe end his head sank forward and he went off again.",
        "And then again someone nudged him, and he sat up with his old terrified\r\nstart!",
        "He had been snoring again, of course!",
        "And now what?",
        "He fixed his\r\neyes ahead of him, with painful intensity, staring at the platform as\r\nif nothing else ever had interested him, or ever could interest him,\r\nall his life.",
        "He imagined the angry exclamations, the hostile glances;\r\nhe imagined the policeman striding toward him—reaching for his neck.",
        "Or\r\nwas he to have one more chance?",
        "Were they going to let him alone this\r\ntime?",
        "He sat trembling; waiting—\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly came a voice in his ear, a woman’s voice, gentle and\r\nsweet, “If you would try to listen, comrade, perhaps you would be\r\ninterested.”\r\n\r\nJurgis was more startled by that than he would have been by the touch\r\nof a policeman.",
        "He still kept his eyes fixed ahead, and did not stir;\r\nbut his heart gave a great leap.",
        "Comrade!",
        "Who was it that called him\r\n“comrade”?",
        "He waited long, long; and at last, when he was sure that he was no\r\nlonger watched, he stole a glance out of the corner of his eyes at the\r\nwoman who sat beside him.",
        "She was young and beautiful; she wore fine\r\nclothes, and was what is called a “lady.” And she called him “comrade”!",
        "He turned a little, carefully, so that he could see her better; then he\r\nbegan to watch her, fascinated.",
        "She had apparently forgotten all about\r\nhim, and was looking toward the platform.",
        "A man was speaking\r\nthere—Jurgis heard his voice vaguely; but all his thoughts were for\r\nthis woman’s face.",
        "A feeling of alarm stole over him as he stared at\r\nher.",
        "It made his flesh creep.",
        "What was the matter with her, what could\r\nbe going on, to affect any one like that?",
        "She sat as one turned to\r\nstone, her hands clenched tightly in her lap, so tightly that he could\r\nsee the cords standing out in her wrists.",
        "There was a look of\r\nexcitement upon her face, of tense effort, as of one struggling\r\nmightily, or witnessing a struggle.",
        "There was a faint quivering of her\r\nnostrils; and now and then she would moisten her lips with feverish\r\nhaste.",
        "Her bosom rose and fell as she breathed, and her excitement\r\nseemed to mount higher and higher, and then to sink away again, like a\r\nboat tossing upon ocean surges.",
        "What was it?",
        "What was the matter?",
        "It\r\nmust be something that the man was saying, up there on the platform.",
        "What sort of a man was he?",
        "And what sort of thing was this, anyhow?—So\r\nall at once it occurred to Jurgis to look at the speaker.",
        "It was like coming suddenly upon some wild sight of nature—a mountain\r\nforest lashed by a tempest, a ship tossed about upon a stormy sea.",
        "Jurgis had an unpleasant sensation, a sense of confusion, of disorder,\r\nof wild and meaningless uproar.",
        "The man was tall and gaunt, as haggard\r\nas his auditor himself; a thin black beard covered half of his face,\r\nand one could see only two black hollows where the eyes were.",
        "He was\r\nspeaking rapidly, in great excitement; he used many gestures—as he\r\nspoke he moved here and there upon the stage, reaching with his long\r\narms as if to seize each person in his audience.",
        "His voice was deep,\r\nlike an organ; it was some time, however, before Jurgis thought of the\r\nvoice—he was too much occupied with his eyes to think of what the man\r\nwas saying.",
        "But suddenly it seemed as if the speaker had begun pointing\r\nstraight at him, as if he had singled him out particularly for his\r\nremarks; and so Jurgis became suddenly aware of his voice, trembling,\r\nvibrant with emotion, with pain and longing, with a burden of things\r\nunutterable, not to be compassed by words.",
        "To hear it was to be\r\nsuddenly arrested, to be gripped, transfixed.",
        "“You listen to these things,” the man was saying, “and you say, ‘Yes,\r\nthey are true, but they have been that way always.’ Or you say, ‘Maybe\r\nit will come, but not in my time—it will not help me.’ And so you\r\nreturn to your daily round of toil, you go back to be ground up for\r\nprofits in the world-wide mill of economic might!",
        "To toil long hours\r\nfor another’s advantage; to live in mean and squalid homes, to work in\r\ndangerous and unhealthful places; to wrestle with the specters of\r\nhunger and privation, to take your chances of accident, disease, and\r\ndeath.",
        "And each day the struggle becomes fiercer, the pace more cruel;\r\neach day you have to toil a little harder, and feel the iron hand of\r\ncircumstance close upon you a little tighter.",
        "Months pass, years\r\nmaybe—and then you come again; and again I am here to plead with you,\r\nto know if want and misery have yet done their work with you, if\r\ninjustice and oppression have yet opened your eyes!",
        "I shall still be\r\nwaiting—there is nothing else that I can do.",
        "There is no wilderness\r\nwhere I can hide from these things, there is no haven where I can\r\nescape them; though I travel to the ends of the earth, I find the same\r\naccursed system—I find that all the fair and noble impulses of\r\nhumanity, the dreams of poets and the agonies of martyrs, are shackled\r\nand bound in the service of organized and predatory Greed!",
        "And\r\ntherefore I cannot rest, I cannot be silent; therefore I cast aside\r\ncomfort and happiness, health and good repute—and go out into the world\r\nand cry out the pain of my spirit!",
        "Therefore I am not to be silenced by\r\npoverty and sickness, not by hatred and obloquy, by threats and\r\nridicule—not by prison and persecution, if they should come—not by any\r\npower that is upon the earth or above the earth, that was, or is, or\r\never can be created.",
        "If I fail tonight, I can only try tomorrow;\r\nknowing that the fault must be mine—that if once the vision of my soul\r\nwere spoken upon earth, if once the anguish of its defeat were uttered\r\nin human speech, it would break the stoutest barriers of prejudice, it\r\nwould shake the most sluggish soul to action!",
        "It would abash the most\r\ncynical, it would terrify the most selfish; and the voice of mockery\r\nwould be silenced, and fraud and falsehood would slink back into their\r\ndens, and the truth would stand forth alone!",
        "For I speak with the voice\r\nof the millions who are voiceless!",
        "Of them that are oppressed and have\r\nno comforter!",
        "Of the disinherited of life, for whom there is no respite\r\nand no deliverance, to whom the world is a prison, a dungeon of\r\ntorture, a tomb!",
        "With the voice of the little child who toils tonight\r\nin a Southern cotton mill, staggering with exhaustion, numb with agony,\r\nand knowing no hope but the grave!",
        "Of the mother who sews by\r\ncandlelight in her tenement garret, weary and weeping, smitten with the\r\nmortal hunger of her babes!",
        "Of the man who lies upon a bed of rags,\r\nwrestling in his last sickness and leaving his loved ones to perish!",
        "Of\r\nthe young girl who, somewhere at this moment, is walking the streets of\r\nthis horrible city, beaten and starving, and making her choice between\r\nthe brothel and the lake!",
        "With the voice of those, whoever and wherever\r\nthey may be, who are caught beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of\r\nGreed!",
        "With the voice of humanity, calling for deliverance!",
        "Of the\r\neverlasting soul of Man, arising from the dust; breaking its way out of\r\nits prison—rending the bands of oppression and ignorance—groping its\r\nway to the light!”\r\n\r\nThe speaker paused.",
        "There was an instant of silence, while men caught\r\ntheir breaths, and then like a single sound there came a cry from a\r\nthousand people.",
        "Through it all Jurgis sat still, motionless and rigid,\r\nhis eyes fixed upon the speaker; he was trembling, smitten with wonder.",
        "Suddenly the man raised his hands, and silence fell, and he began\r\nagain.",
        "“I plead with you,” he said, “whoever you may be, provided that you\r\ncare about the truth; but most of all I plead with working-man, with\r\nthose to whom the evils I portray are not mere matters of sentiment, to\r\nbe dallied and toyed with, and then perhaps put aside and forgotten—to\r\nwhom they are the grim and relentless realities of the daily grind, the\r\nchains upon their limbs, the lash upon their backs, the iron in their\r\nsouls.",
        "To you, working-men!",
        "To you, the toilers, who have made this\r\nland, and have no voice in its councils!",
        "To you, whose lot it is to sow\r\nthat others may reap, to labor and obey, and ask no more than the wages\r\nof a beast of burden, the food and shelter to keep you alive from day\r\nto day.",
        "It is to you that I come with my message of salvation, it is to\r\nyou that I appeal.",
        "I know how much it is to ask of you—I know, for I\r\nhave been in your place, I have lived your life, and there is no man\r\nbefore me here tonight who knows it better.",
        "I have known what it is to\r\nbe a street-waif, a bootblack, living upon a crust of bread and\r\nsleeping in cellar stairways and under empty wagons.",
        "I have known what\r\nit is to dare and to aspire, to dream mighty dreams and to see them\r\nperish—to see all the fair flowers of my spirit trampled into the mire\r\nby the wild-beast powers of my life.",
        "I know what is the price that a\r\nworking-man pays for knowledge—I have paid for it with food and sleep,\r\nwith agony of body and mind, with health, almost with life itself; and\r\nso, when I come to you with a story of hope and freedom, with the\r\nvision of a new earth to be created, of a new labor to be dared, I am\r\nnot surprised that I find you sordid and material, sluggish and\r\nincredulous.",
        "That I do not despair is because I know also the forces\r\nthat are driving behind you—because I know the raging lash of poverty,\r\nthe sting of contempt and mastership, ‘the insolence of office and the\r\nspurns.’ Because I feel sure that in the crowd that has come to me\r\ntonight, no matter how many may be dull and heedless, no matter how\r\nmany may have come out of idle curiosity, or in order to ridicule—there\r\nwill be some one man whom pain and suffering have made desperate, whom\r\nsome chance vision of wrong and horror has startled and shocked into\r\nattention.",
        "And to him my words will come like a sudden flash of\r\nlightning to one who travels in darkness—revealing the way before him,\r\nthe perils and the obstacles—solving all problems, making all\r\ndifficulties clear!",
        "The scales will fall from his eyes, the shackles\r\nwill be torn from his limbs—he will leap up with a cry of thankfulness,\r\nhe will stride forth a free man at last!",
        "A man delivered from his\r\nself-created slavery!",
        "A man who will never more be trapped—whom no\r\nblandishments will cajole, whom no threats will frighten; who from\r\ntonight on will move forward, and not backward, who will study and\r\nunderstand, who will gird on his sword and take his place in the army\r\nof his comrades and brothers.",
        "Who will carry the good tidings to\r\nothers, as I have carried them to him—priceless gift of liberty and\r\nlight that is neither mine nor his, but is the heritage of the soul of\r\nman!",
        "Working-men, working-men—comrades!",
        "open your eyes and look about\r\nyou!",
        "You have lived so long in the toil and heat that your senses are\r\ndulled, your souls are numbed; but realize once in your lives this\r\nworld in which you dwell—tear off the rags of its customs and\r\nconventions—behold it as it is, in all its hideous nakedness!",
        "Realize\r\nit, _realize it!_ Realize that out upon the plains of Manchuria tonight\r\ntwo hostile armies are facing each other—that now, while we are seated\r\nhere, a million human beings may be hurled at each other’s throats,\r\nstriving with the fury of maniacs to tear each other to pieces!",
        "And\r\nthis in the twentieth century, nineteen hundred years since the Prince\r\nof Peace was born on earth!",
        "Nineteen hundred years that his words have\r\nbeen preached as divine, and here two armies of men are rending and\r\ntearing each other like the wild beasts of the forest!",
        "Philosophers\r\nhave reasoned, prophets have denounced, poets have wept and pleaded—and\r\nstill this hideous Monster roams at large!",
        "We have schools and\r\ncolleges, newspapers and books; we have searched the heavens and the\r\nearth, we have weighed and probed and reasoned—and all to equip men to\r\ndestroy each other!",
        "We call it War, and pass it by—but do not put me\r\noff with platitudes and conventions—come with me, come with me—_realize\r\nit!_ See the bodies of men pierced by bullets, blown into pieces by\r\nbursting shells!",
        "Hear the crunching of the bayonet, plunged into human\r\nflesh; hear the groans and shrieks of agony, see the faces of men\r\ncrazed by pain, turned into fiends by fury and hate!",
        "Put your hand upon\r\nthat piece of flesh—it is hot and quivering—just now it was a part of a\r\nman!",
        "This blood is still steaming—it was driven by a human heart!",
        "Almighty God!",
        "and this goes on—it is systematic, organized,\r\npremeditated!",
        "And we know it, and read of it, and take it for granted;\r\nour papers tell of it, and the presses are not stopped—our churches\r\nknow of it, and do not close their doors—the people behold it, and do\r\nnot rise up in horror and revolution!",
        "“Or perhaps Manchuria is too far away for you—come home with me then,\r\ncome here to Chicago.",
        "Here in this city to-night ten thousand women are\r\nshut up in foul pens, and driven by hunger to sell their bodies to\r\nlive.",
        "And we know it, we make it a jest!",
        "And these women are made in\r\nthe image of your mothers, they may be your sisters, your daughters;\r\nthe child whom you left at home tonight, whose laughing eyes will greet\r\nyou in the morning—that fate may be waiting for her!",
        "To-night in\r\nChicago there are ten thousand men, homeless and wretched, willing to\r\nwork and begging for a chance, yet starving, and fronting in terror the\r\nawful winter cold!",
        "Tonight in Chicago there are a hundred thousand\r\nchildren wearing out their strength and blasting their lives in the\r\neffort to earn their bread!",
        "There are a hundred thousand mothers who\r\nare living in misery and squalor, struggling to earn enough to feed\r\ntheir little ones!",
        "There are a hundred thousand old people, cast off\r\nand helpless, waiting for death to take them from their torments!",
        "There\r\nare a million people, men and women and children, who share the curse\r\nof the wage-slave; who toil every hour they can stand and see, for just\r\nenough to keep them alive; who are condemned till the end of their days\r\nto monotony and weariness, to hunger and misery, to heat and cold, to\r\ndirt and disease, to ignorance and drunkenness and vice!",
        "And then turn\r\nover the page with me, and gaze upon the other side of the picture.",
        "There are a thousand—ten thousand, maybe—who are the masters of these\r\nslaves, who own their toil.",
        "They do nothing to earn what they receive,\r\nthey do not even have to ask for it—it comes to them of itself, their\r\nonly care is to dispose of it.",
        "They live in palaces, they riot in\r\nluxury and extravagance—such as no words can describe, as makes the\r\nimagination reel and stagger, makes the soul grow sick and faint.",
        "They\r\nspend hundreds of dollars for a pair of shoes, a handkerchief, a\r\ngarter; they spend millions for horses and automobiles and yachts, for\r\npalaces and banquets, for little shiny stones with which to deck their\r\nbodies.",
        "Their life is a contest among themselves for supremacy in\r\nostentation and recklessness, in the destroying of useful and necessary\r\nthings, in the wasting of the labor and the lives of their fellow\r\ncreatures, the toil and anguish of the nations, the sweat and tears and\r\nblood of the human race!",
        "It is all theirs—it comes to them; just as all\r\nthe springs pour into streamlets, and the streamlets into rivers, and\r\nthe rivers into the oceans—so, automatically and inevitably, all the\r\nwealth of society comes to them.",
        "The farmer tills the soil, the miner\r\ndigs in the earth, the weaver tends the loom, the mason carves the\r\nstone; the clever man invents, the shrewd man directs, the wise man\r\nstudies, the inspired man sings—and all the result, the products of the\r\nlabor of brain and muscle, are gathered into one stupendous stream and\r\npoured into their laps!",
        "The whole of society is in their grip, the\r\nwhole labor of the world lies at their mercy—and like fierce wolves\r\nthey rend and destroy, like ravening vultures they devour and tear!",
        "The\r\nwhole power of mankind belongs to them, forever and beyond recall—do\r\nwhat it can, strive as it will, humanity lives for them and dies for\r\nthem!",
        "They own not merely the labor of society, they have bought the\r\ngovernments; and everywhere they use their raped and stolen power to\r\nintrench themselves in their privileges, to dig wider and deeper the\r\nchannels through which the river of profits flows to them!—And you,\r\nworkingmen, workingmen!",
        "You have been brought up to it, you plod on\r\nlike beasts of burden, thinking only of the day and its pain—yet is\r\nthere a man among you who can believe that such a system will continue\r\nforever—is there a man here in this audience tonight so hardened and\r\ndebased that he dare rise up before me and say that he believes it can\r\ncontinue forever; that the product of the labor of society, the means\r\nof existence of the human race, will always belong to idlers and\r\nparasites, to be spent for the gratification of vanity and lust—to be\r\nspent for any purpose whatever, to be at the disposal of any individual\r\nwill whatever—that somehow, somewhere, the labor of humanity will not\r\nbelong to humanity, to be used for the purposes of humanity, to be\r\ncontrolled by the will of humanity?",
        "And if this is ever to be, how is\r\nit to be—what power is there that will bring it about?",
        "Will it be the\r\ntask of your masters, do you think—will they write the charter of your\r\nliberties?",
        "Will they forge you the sword of your deliverance, will they\r\nmarshal you the army and lead it to the fray?",
        "Will their wealth be\r\nspent for the purpose—will they build colleges and churches to teach\r\nyou, will they print papers to herald your progress, and organize\r\npolitical parties to guide and carry on the struggle?",
        "Can you not see\r\nthat the task is your task—yours to dream, yours to resolve, yours to\r\nexecute?",
        "That if ever it is carried out, it will be in the face of\r\nevery obstacle that wealth and mastership can oppose—in the face of\r\nridicule and slander, of hatred and persecution, of the bludgeon and\r\nthe jail?",
        "That it will be by the power of your naked bosoms, opposed to\r\nthe rage of oppression!",
        "By the grim and bitter teaching of blind and\r\nmerciless affliction!",
        "By the painful gropings of the untutored mind, by\r\nthe feeble stammerings of the uncultured voice!",
        "By the sad and lonely\r\nhunger of the spirit; by seeking and striving and yearning, by\r\nheartache and despairing, by agony and sweat of blood!",
        "It will be by\r\nmoney paid for with hunger, by knowledge stolen from sleep, by thoughts\r\ncommunicated under the shadow of the gallows!",
        "It will be a movement\r\nbeginning in the far-off past, a thing obscure and unhonored, a thing\r\neasy to ridicule, easy to despise; a thing unlovely, wearing the aspect\r\nof vengeance and hate—but to you, the working-man, the wage-slave,\r\ncalling with a voice insistent, imperious—with a voice that you cannot\r\nescape, wherever upon the earth you may be!",
        "With the voice of all your\r\nwrongs, with the voice of all your desires; with the voice of your duty\r\nand your hope—of everything in the world that is worth while to you!",
        "The voice of the poor, demanding that poverty shall cease!",
        "The voice of\r\nthe oppressed, pronouncing the doom of oppression!",
        "The voice of power,\r\nwrought out of suffering—of resolution, crushed out of weakness—of joy\r\nand courage, born in the bottomless pit of anguish and despair!",
        "The\r\nvoice of Labor, despised and outraged; a mighty giant, lying\r\nprostrate—mountainous, colossal, but blinded, bound, and ignorant of\r\nhis strength.",
        "And now a dream of resistance haunts him, hope battling\r\nwith fear; until suddenly he stirs, and a fetter snaps—and a thrill\r\nshoots through him, to the farthest ends of his huge body, and in a\r\nflash the dream becomes an act!",
        "He starts, he lifts himself; and the\r\nbands are shattered, the burdens roll off him—he rises—towering,\r\ngigantic; he springs to his feet, he shouts in his newborn exultation—”\r\n\r\nAnd the speaker’s voice broke suddenly, with the stress of his\r\nfeelings; he stood with his arms stretched out above him, and the power\r\nof his vision seemed to lift him from the floor.",
        "The audience came to\r\nits feet with a yell; men waved their arms, laughing aloud in their\r\nexcitement.",
        "And Jurgis was with them, he was shouting to tear his\r\nthroat; shouting because he could not help it, because the stress of\r\nhis feeling was more than he could bear.",
        "It was not merely the man’s\r\nwords, the torrent of his eloquence.",
        "It was his presence, it was his\r\nvoice: a voice with strange intonations that rang through the chambers\r\nof the soul like the clanging of a bell—that gripped the listener like\r\na mighty hand about his body, that shook him and startled him with\r\nsudden fright, with a sense of things not of earth, of mysteries never\r\nspoken before, of presences of awe and terror!",
        "There was an unfolding\r\nof vistas before him, a breaking of the ground beneath him, an\r\nupheaving, a stirring, a trembling; he felt himself suddenly a mere man\r\nno longer—there were powers within him undreamed of, there were demon\r\nforces contending, age-long wonders struggling to be born; and he sat\r\noppressed with pain and joy, while a tingling stole down into his\r\nfinger tips, and his breath came hard and fast.",
        "The sentences of this\r\nman were to Jurgis like the crashing of thunder in his soul; a flood of\r\nemotions surged up in him—all his old hopes and longings, his old\r\ngriefs and rages and despairs.",
        "All that he had ever felt in his whole\r\nlife seemed to come back to him at once, and with one new emotion,\r\nhardly to be described.",
        "That he should have suffered such oppressions\r\nand such horrors was bad enough; but that he should have been crushed\r\nand beaten by them, that he should have submitted, and forgotten, and\r\nlived in peace—ah, truly that was a thing not to be put into words, a\r\nthing not to be borne by a human creature, a thing of terror and\r\nmadness!",
        "“What,” asks the prophet, “is the murder of them that kill the\r\nbody, to the murder of them that kill the soul?” And Jurgis was a man\r\nwhose soul had been murdered, who had ceased to hope and to\r\nstruggle—who had made terms with degradation and despair; and now,\r\nsuddenly, in one awful convulsion, the black and hideous fact was made\r\nplain to him!",
        "There was a falling in of all the pillars of his soul,\r\nthe sky seemed to split above him—he stood there, with his clenched\r\nhands upraised, his eyes bloodshot, and the veins standing out purple\r\nin his face, roaring in the voice of a wild beast, frantic, incoherent,\r\nmaniacal.",
        "And when he could shout no more he still stood there,\r\ngasping, and whispering hoarsely to himself: “By God!",
        "By God!",
        "By God!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man had gone back to a seat upon the platform, and Jurgis realized\r\nthat his speech was over.",
        "The applause continued for several minutes;\r\nand then some one started a song, and the crowd took it up, and the\r\nplace shook with it.",
        "Jurgis had never heard it, and he could not make\r\nout the words, but the wild and wonderful spirit of it seized upon\r\nhim—it was the “Marseillaise!” As stanza after stanza of it thundered\r\nforth, he sat with his hands clasped, trembling in every nerve.",
        "He had\r\nnever been so stirred in his life—it was a miracle that had been\r\nwrought in him.",
        "He could not think at all, he was stunned; yet he knew\r\nthat in the mighty upheaval that had taken place in his soul, a new man\r\nhad been born.",
        "He had been torn out of the jaws of destruction, he had\r\nbeen delivered from the thraldom of despair; the whole world had been\r\nchanged for him—he was free, he was free!",
        "Even if he were to suffer as\r\nhe had before, even if he were to beg and starve, nothing would be the\r\nsame to him; he would understand it, and bear it.",
        "He would no longer be\r\nthe sport of circumstances, he would be a man, with a will and a\r\npurpose; he would have something to fight for, something to die for, if\r\nneed be!",
        "Here were men who would show him and help him; and he would\r\nhave friends and allies, he would dwell in the sight of justice, and\r\nwalk arm in arm with power.",
        "The audience subsided again, and Jurgis sat back.",
        "The chairman of the\r\nmeeting came forward and began to speak.",
        "His voice sounded thin and\r\nfutile after the other’s, and to Jurgis it seemed a profanation.",
        "Why\r\nshould any one else speak, after that miraculous man—why should they\r\nnot all sit in silence?",
        "The chairman was explaining that a collection\r\nwould now be taken up to defray the expenses of the meeting, and for\r\nthe benefit of the campaign fund of the party.",
        "Jurgis heard; but he had\r\nnot a penny to give, and so his thoughts went elsewhere again.",
        "He kept his eyes fixed on the orator, who sat in an armchair, his head\r\nleaning on his hand and his attitude indicating exhaustion.",
        "But\r\nsuddenly he stood up again, and Jurgis heard the chairman of the\r\nmeeting saying that the speaker would now answer any questions which\r\nthe audience might care to put to him.",
        "The man came forward, and some\r\none—a woman—arose and asked about some opinion the speaker had\r\nexpressed concerning Tolstoy.",
        "Jurgis had never heard of Tolstoy, and\r\ndid not care anything about him.",
        "Why should any one want to ask such\r\nquestions, after an address like that?",
        "The thing was not to talk, but\r\nto do; the thing was to get bold of others and rouse them, to organize\r\nthem and prepare for the fight!",
        "But still the discussion went on, in\r\nordinary conversational tones, and it brought Jurgis back to the\r\neveryday world.",
        "A few minutes ago he had felt like seizing the hand of\r\nthe beautiful lady by his side, and kissing it; he had felt like\r\nflinging his arms about the neck of the man on the other side of him.",
        "And now he began to realize again that he was a “hobo,” that he was\r\nragged and dirty, and smelled bad, and had no place to sleep that\r\nnight!",
        "And so, at last, when the meeting broke up, and the audience started to\r\nleave, poor Jurgis was in an agony of uncertainty.",
        "He had not thought\r\nof leaving—he had thought that the vision must last forever, that he\r\nhad found comrades and brothers.",
        "But now he would go out, and the thing\r\nwould fade away, and he would never be able to find it again!",
        "He sat in\r\nhis seat, frightened and wondering; but others in the same row wanted\r\nto get out, and so he had to stand up and move along.",
        "As he was swept\r\ndown the aisle he looked from one person to another, wistfully; they\r\nwere all excitedly discussing the address—but there was nobody who\r\noffered to discuss it with him.",
        "He was near enough to the door to feel\r\nthe night air, when desperation seized him.",
        "He knew nothing at all\r\nabout that speech he had heard, not even the name of the orator; and he\r\nwas to go away—no, no, it was preposterous, he must speak to some one;\r\nhe must find that man himself and tell him.",
        "He would not despise him,\r\ntramp as he was!",
        "So he stepped into an empty row of seats and watched, and when the\r\ncrowd had thinned out, he started toward the platform.",
        "The speaker was\r\ngone; but there was a stage door that stood open, with people passing\r\nin and out, and no one on guard.",
        "Jurgis summoned up his courage and\r\nwent in, and down a hallway, and to the door of a room where many\r\npeople were crowded.",
        "No one paid any attention to him, and he pushed\r\nin, and in a corner he saw the man he sought.",
        "The orator sat in a\r\nchair, with his shoulders sunk together and his eyes half closed; his\r\nface was ghastly pale, almost greenish in hue, and one arm lay limp at\r\nhis side.",
        "A big man with spectacles on stood near him, and kept pushing\r\nback the crowd, saying, “Stand away a little, please; can’t you see the\r\ncomrade is worn out?”\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis stood watching, while five or ten minutes passed.",
        "Now and\r\nthen the man would look up, and address a word or two to those who were\r\nnear him; and, at last, on one of these occasions, his glance rested on\r\nJurgis.",
        "There seemed to be a slight hint of inquiry about it, and a\r\nsudden impulse seized the other.",
        "He stepped forward.",
        "“I wanted to thank you, sir!” he began, in breathless haste.",
        "“I could\r\nnot go away without telling you how much—how glad I am I heard you.",
        "I—I\r\ndidn’t know anything about it all—”\r\n\r\nThe big man with the spectacles, who had moved away, came back at this\r\nmoment.",
        "“The comrade is too tired to talk to any one—” he began; but\r\nthe other held up his hand.",
        "“Wait,” he said.",
        "“He has something to say to me.” And then he looked\r\ninto Jurgis’s face.",
        "“You want to know more about Socialism?” he asked.",
        "Jurgis started.",
        "“I—I—” he stammered.",
        "“Is it Socialism?",
        "I didn’t know.",
        "I\r\nwant to know about what you spoke of—I want to help.",
        "I have been\r\nthrough all that.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you live?” asked the other.",
        "“I have no home,” said Jurgis, “I am out of work.”\r\n\r\n“You are a foreigner, are you not?”\r\n\r\n“Lithuanian, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe man thought for a moment, and then turned to his friend.",
        "“Who is\r\nthere, Walters?” he asked.",
        "“There is Ostrinski—but he is a Pole—”\r\n\r\n“Ostrinski speaks Lithuanian,” said the other.",
        "“All right, then; would\r\nyou mind seeing if he has gone yet?”\r\n\r\nThe other started away, and the speaker looked at Jurgis again.",
        "He had\r\ndeep, black eyes, and a face full of gentleness and pain.",
        "“You must\r\nexcuse me, comrade,” he said.",
        "“I am just tired out—I have spoken every\r\nday for the last month.",
        "I will introduce you to some one who will be\r\nable to help you as well as I could—”\r\n\r\nThe messenger had had to go no further than the door, he came back,\r\nfollowed by a man whom he introduced to Jurgis as “Comrade Ostrinski.”\r\nComrade Ostrinski was a little man, scarcely up to Jurgis’s shoulder,\r\nwizened and wrinkled, very ugly, and slightly lame.",
        "He had on a\r\nlong-tailed black coat, worn green at the seams and the buttonholes;\r\nhis eyes must have been weak, for he wore green spectacles that gave\r\nhim a grotesque appearance.",
        "But his handclasp was hearty, and he spoke\r\nin Lithuanian, which warmed Jurgis to him.",
        "“You want to know about Socialism?” he said.",
        "“Surely.",
        "Let us go out and\r\ntake a stroll, where we can be quiet and talk some.”\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis bade farewell to the master wizard, and went out.",
        "Ostrinski asked where he lived, offering to walk in that direction; and\r\nso he had to explain once more that he was without a home.",
        "At the\r\nother’s request he told his story; how he had come to America, and what\r\nhad happened to him in the stockyards, and how his family had been\r\nbroken up, and how he had become a wanderer.",
        "So much the little man\r\nheard, and then he pressed Jurgis’s arm tightly.",
        "“You have been through\r\nthe mill, comrade!” he said.",
        "“We will make a fighter out of you!”\r\n\r\nThen Ostrinski in turn explained his circumstances.",
        "He would have asked\r\nJurgis to his home—but he had only two rooms, and had no bed to offer.",
        "He would have given up his own bed, but his wife was ill.",
        "Later on,\r\nwhen he understood that otherwise Jurgis would have to sleep in a\r\nhallway, he offered him his kitchen floor, a chance which the other was\r\nonly too glad to accept.",
        "“Perhaps tomorrow we can do better,” said\r\nOstrinski.",
        "“We try not to let a comrade starve.”\r\n\r\nOstrinski’s home was in the Ghetto district, where he had two rooms in\r\nthe basement of a tenement.",
        "There was a baby crying as they entered,\r\nand he closed the door leading into the bedroom.",
        "He had three young\r\nchildren, he explained, and a baby had just come.",
        "He drew up two chairs\r\nnear the kitchen stove, adding that Jurgis must excuse the disorder of\r\nthe place, since at such a time one’s domestic arrangements were upset.",
        "Half of the kitchen was given up to a workbench, which was piled with\r\nclothing, and Ostrinski explained that he was a “pants finisher.” He\r\nbrought great bundles of clothing here to his home, where he and his\r\nwife worked on them.",
        "He made a living at it, but it was getting harder\r\nall the time, because his eyes were failing.",
        "What would come when they\r\ngave out he could not tell; there had been no saving anything—a man\r\ncould barely keep alive by twelve or fourteen hours’ work a day.",
        "The\r\nfinishing of pants did not take much skill, and anybody could learn it,\r\nand so the pay was forever getting less.",
        "That was the competitive wage\r\nsystem; and if Jurgis wanted to understand what Socialism was, it was\r\nthere he had best begin.",
        "The workers were dependent upon a job to exist\r\nfrom day to day, and so they bid against each other, and no man could\r\nget more than the lowest man would consent to work for.",
        "And thus the\r\nmass of the people were always in a life-and-death struggle with\r\npoverty.",
        "That was “competition,” so far as it concerned the\r\nwage-earner, the man who had only his labor to sell; to those on top,\r\nthe exploiters, it appeared very differently, of course—there were few\r\nof them, and they could combine and dominate, and their power would be\r\nunbreakable.",
        "And so all over the world two classes were forming, with\r\nan unbridged chasm between them—the capitalist class, with its enormous\r\nfortunes, and the proletariat, bound into slavery by unseen chains.",
        "The\r\nlatter were a thousand to one in numbers, but they were ignorant and\r\nhelpless, and they would remain at the mercy of their exploiters until\r\nthey were organized—until they had become “class-conscious.” It was a\r\nslow and weary process, but it would go on—it was like the movement of\r\na glacier, once it was started it could never be stopped.",
        "Every\r\nSocialist did his share, and lived upon the vision of the “good time\r\ncoming,”—when the working class should go to the polls and seize the\r\npowers of government, and put an end to private property in the means\r\nof production.",
        "No matter how poor a man was, or how much he suffered,\r\nhe could never be really unhappy while he knew of that future; even if\r\nhe did not live to see it himself, his children would, and, to a\r\nSocialist, the victory of his class was his victory.",
        "Also he had always\r\nthe progress to encourage him; here in Chicago, for instance, the\r\nmovement was growing by leaps and bounds.",
        "Chicago was the industrial\r\ncenter of the country, and nowhere else were the unions so strong; but\r\ntheir organizations did the workers little good, for the employers were\r\norganized, also; and so the strikes generally failed, and as fast as\r\nthe unions were broken up the men were coming over to the Socialists.",
        "Ostrinski explained the organization of the party, the machinery by\r\nwhich the proletariat was educating itself.",
        "There were “locals” in\r\nevery big city and town, and they were being organized rapidly in the\r\nsmaller places; a local had anywhere from six to a thousand members,\r\nand there were fourteen hundred of them in all, with a total of about\r\ntwenty-five thousand members, who paid dues to support the\r\norganization.",
        "“Local Cook County,” as the city organization was called,\r\nhad eighty branch locals, and it alone was spending several thousand\r\ndollars in the campaign.",
        "It published a weekly in English, and one each\r\nin Bohemian and German; also there was a monthly published in Chicago,\r\nand a cooperative publishing house, that issued a million and a half of\r\nSocialist books and pamphlets every year.",
        "All this was the growth of\r\nthe last few years—there had been almost nothing of it when Ostrinski\r\nfirst came to Chicago.",
        "Ostrinski was a Pole, about fifty years of age.",
        "He had lived in\r\nSilesia, a member of a despised and persecuted race, and had taken part\r\nin the proletarian movement in the early seventies, when Bismarck,\r\nhaving conquered France, had turned his policy of blood and iron upon\r\nthe “International.” Ostrinski himself had twice been in jail, but he\r\nhad been young then, and had not cared.",
        "He had had more of his share of\r\nthe fight, though, for just when Socialism had broken all its barriers\r\nand become the great political force of the empire, he had come to\r\nAmerica, and begun all over again.",
        "In America every one had laughed at\r\nthe mere idea of Socialism then—in America all men were free.",
        "As if\r\npolitical liberty made wage slavery any the more tolerable!",
        "said\r\nOstrinski.",
        "The little tailor sat tilted back in his stiff kitchen chair, with his\r\nfeet stretched out upon the empty stove, and speaking in low whispers,\r\nso as not to waken those in the next room.",
        "To Jurgis he seemed a\r\nscarcely less wonderful person than the speaker at the meeting; he was\r\npoor, the lowest of the low, hunger-driven and miserable—and yet how\r\nmuch he knew, how much he had dared and achieved, what a hero he had\r\nbeen!",
        "There were others like him, too—thousands like him, and all of\r\nthem workingmen!",
        "That all this wonderful machinery of progress had been\r\ncreated by his fellows—Jurgis could not believe it, it seemed too good\r\nto be true.",
        "That was always the way, said Ostrinski; when a man was first converted\r\nto Socialism he was like a crazy person—he could not understand how\r\nothers could fail to see it, and he expected to convert all the world\r\nthe first week.",
        "After a while he would realize how hard a task it was;\r\nand then it would be fortunate that other new hands kept coming, to\r\nsave him from settling down into a rut.",
        "Just now Jurgis would have\r\nplenty of chance to vent his excitement, for a presidential campaign\r\nwas on, and everybody was talking politics.",
        "Ostrinski would take him to\r\nthe next meeting of the branch local, and introduce him, and he might\r\njoin the party.",
        "The dues were five cents a week, but any one who could\r\nnot afford this might be excused from paying.",
        "The Socialist party was a\r\nreally democratic political organization—it was controlled absolutely\r\nby its own membership, and had no bosses.",
        "All of these things Ostrinski\r\nexplained, as also the principles of the party.",
        "You might say that\r\nthere was really but one Socialist principle—that of “no compromise,”\r\nwhich was the essence of the proletarian movement all over the world.",
        "When a Socialist was elected to office he voted with old party\r\nlegislators for any measure that was likely to be of help to the\r\nworking class, but he never forgot that these concessions, whatever\r\nthey might be, were trifles compared with the great purpose—the\r\norganizing of the working class for the revolution.",
        "So far, the rule in\r\nAmerica had been that one Socialist made another Socialist once every\r\ntwo years; and if they should maintain the same rate they would carry\r\nthe country in 1912—though not all of them expected to succeed as\r\nquickly as that.",
        "The Socialists were organized in every civilized nation; it was an\r\ninternational political party, said Ostrinski, the greatest the world\r\nhad ever known.",
        "It numbered thirty million of adherents, and it cast\r\neight million votes.",
        "It had started its first newspaper in Japan, and\r\nelected its first deputy in Argentina; in France it named members of\r\ncabinets, and in Italy and Australia it held the balance of power and\r\nturned out ministries.",
        "In Germany, where its vote was more than a third\r\nof the total vote of the empire, all other parties and powers had\r\nunited to fight it.",
        "It would not do, Ostrinski explained, for the\r\nproletariat of one nation to achieve the victory, for that nation would\r\nbe crushed by the military power of the others; and so the Socialist\r\nmovement was a world movement, an organization of all mankind to\r\nestablish liberty and fraternity.",
        "It was the new religion of\r\nhumanity—or you might say it was the fulfillment of the old religion,\r\nsince it implied but the literal application of all the teachings of\r\nChrist.",
        "Until long after midnight Jurgis sat lost in the conversation of his\r\nnew acquaintance.",
        "It was a most wonderful experience to him—an almost\r\nsupernatural experience.",
        "It was like encountering an inhabitant of the\r\nfourth dimension of space, a being who was free from all one’s own\r\nlimitations.",
        "For four years, now, Jurgis had been wondering and\r\nblundering in the depths of a wilderness; and here, suddenly, a hand\r\nreached down and seized him, and lifted him out of it, and set him upon\r\na mountain-top, from which he could survey it all—could see the paths\r\nfrom which he had wandered, the morasses into which he had stumbled,\r\nthe hiding places of the beasts of prey that had fallen upon him.",
        "There\r\nwere his Packingtown experiences, for instance—what was there about\r\nPackingtown that Ostrinski could not explain!",
        "To Jurgis the packers had\r\nbeen equivalent to fate; Ostrinski showed him that they were the Beef\r\nTrust.",
        "They were a gigantic combination of capital, which had crushed\r\nall opposition, and overthrown the laws of the land, and was preying\r\nupon the people.",
        "Jurgis recollected how, when he had first come to\r\nPackingtown, he had stood and watched the hog-killing, and thought how\r\ncruel and savage it was, and come away congratulating himself that he\r\nwas not a hog; now his new acquaintance showed him that a hog was just\r\nwhat he had been—one of the packers’ hogs.",
        "What they wanted from a hog\r\nwas all the profits that could be got out of him; and that was what\r\nthey wanted from the workingman, and also that was what they wanted\r\nfrom the public.",
        "What the hog thought of it, and what he suffered, were\r\nnot considered; and no more was it with labor, and no more with the\r\npurchaser of meat.",
        "That was true everywhere in the world, but it was\r\nespecially true in Packingtown; there seemed to be something about the\r\nwork of slaughtering that tended to ruthlessness and ferocity—it was\r\nliterally the fact that in the methods of the packers a hundred human\r\nlives did not balance a penny of profit.",
        "When Jurgis had made himself\r\nfamiliar with the Socialist literature, as he would very quickly, he\r\nwould get glimpses of the Beef Trust from all sorts of aspects, and he\r\nwould find it everywhere the same; it was the incarnation of blind and\r\ninsensate Greed.",
        "It was a monster devouring with a thousand mouths,\r\ntrampling with a thousand hoofs; it was the Great Butcher—it was the\r\nspirit of Capitalism made flesh.",
        "Upon the ocean of commerce it sailed\r\nas a pirate ship; it had hoisted the black flag and declared war upon\r\ncivilization.",
        "Bribery and corruption were its everyday methods.",
        "In\r\nChicago the city government was simply one of its branch offices; it\r\nstole billions of gallons of city water openly, it dictated to the\r\ncourts the sentences of disorderly strikers, it forbade the mayor to\r\nenforce the building laws against it.",
        "In the national capital it had\r\npower to prevent inspection of its product, and to falsify government\r\nreports; it violated the rebate laws, and when an investigation was\r\nthreatened it burned its books and sent its criminal agents out of the\r\ncountry.",
        "In the commercial world it was a Juggernaut car; it wiped out\r\nthousands of businesses every year, it drove men to madness and\r\nsuicide.",
        "It had forced the price of cattle so low as to destroy the\r\nstock-raising industry, an occupation upon which whole states existed;\r\nit had ruined thousands of butchers who had refused to handle its\r\nproducts.",
        "It divided the country into districts, and fixed the price of\r\nmeat in all of them; and it owned all the refrigerator cars, and levied\r\nan enormous tribute upon all poultry and eggs and fruit and vegetables.",
        "With the millions of dollars a week that poured in upon it, it was\r\nreaching out for the control of other interests, railroads and trolley\r\nlines, gas and electric light franchises—it already owned the leather\r\nand the grain business of the country.",
        "The people were tremendously\r\nstirred up over its encroachments, but nobody had any remedy to\r\nsuggest; it was the task of Socialists to teach and organize them, and\r\nprepare them for the time when they were to seize the huge machine\r\ncalled the Beef Trust, and use it to produce food for human beings and\r\nnot to heap up fortunes for a band of pirates.",
        "It was long after\r\nmidnight when Jurgis lay down upon the floor of Ostrinski’s kitchen;\r\nand yet it was an hour before he could get to sleep, for the glory of\r\nthat joyful vision of the people of Packingtown marching in and taking\r\npossession of the Union Stockyards!",
        "CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis had breakfast with Ostrinski and his family, and then he went\r\nhome to Elzbieta.",
        "He was no longer shy about it—when he went in,\r\ninstead of saying all the things he had been planning to say, he\r\nstarted to tell Elzbieta about the revolution!",
        "At first she thought he\r\nwas out of his mind, and it was hours before she could really feel\r\ncertain that he was himself.",
        "When, however, she had satisfied herself\r\nthat he was sane upon all subjects except politics, she troubled\r\nherself no further about it.",
        "Jurgis was destined to find that\r\nElzbieta’s armor was absolutely impervious to Socialism.",
        "Her soul had\r\nbeen baked hard in the fire of adversity, and there was no altering it\r\nnow; life to her was the hunt for daily bread, and ideas existed for\r\nher only as they bore upon that.",
        "All that interested her in regard to\r\nthis new frenzy which had seized hold of her son-in-law was whether or\r\nnot it had a tendency to make him sober and industrious; and when she\r\nfound he intended to look for work and to contribute his share to the\r\nfamily fund, she gave him full rein to convince her of anything.",
        "A\r\nwonderfully wise little woman was Elzbieta; she could think as quickly\r\nas a hunted rabbit, and in half an hour she had chosen her\r\nlife-attitude to the Socialist movement.",
        "She agreed in everything with\r\nJurgis, except the need of his paying his dues; and she would even go\r\nto a meeting with him now and then, and sit and plan her next day’s\r\ndinner amid the storm.",
        "For a week after he became a convert Jurgis continued to wander about\r\nall day, looking for work; until at last he met with a strange fortune.",
        "He was passing one of Chicago’s innumerable small hotels, and after\r\nsome hesitation he concluded to go in.",
        "A man he took for the proprietor\r\nwas standing in the lobby, and he went up to him and tackled him for a\r\njob.",
        "“What can you do?” the man asked.",
        "“Anything, sir,” said Jurgis, and added quickly: “I’ve been out of work\r\nfor a long time, sir.",
        "I’m an honest man, and I’m strong and willing—”\r\n\r\nThe other was eying him narrowly.",
        "“Do you drink?” he asked.",
        "“No, sir,” said Jurgis.",
        "“Well, I’ve been employing a man as a porter, and he drinks.",
        "I’ve\r\ndischarged him seven times now, and I’ve about made up my mind that’s\r\nenough.",
        "Would you be a porter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“It’s hard work.",
        "You’ll have to clean floors and wash spittoons and\r\nfill lamps and handle trunks—”\r\n\r\n“I’m willing, sir.”\r\n\r\n“All right.",
        "I’ll pay you thirty a month and board, and you can begin\r\nnow, if you feel like it.",
        "You can put on the other fellow’s rig.”\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis fell to work, and toiled like a Trojan till night.",
        "Then\r\nhe went and told Elzbieta, and also, late as it was, he paid a visit to\r\nOstrinski to let him know of his good fortune.",
        "Here he received a great\r\nsurprise, for when he was describing the location of the hotel\r\nOstrinski interrupted suddenly, “Not Hinds’s!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jurgis, “that’s the name.”\r\n\r\nTo which the other replied, “Then you’ve got the best boss in\r\nChicago—he’s a state organizer of our party, and one of our best-known\r\nspeakers!”\r\n\r\nSo the next morning Jurgis went to his employer and told him; and the\r\nman seized him by the hand and shook it.",
        "“By Jove!” he cried, “that\r\nlets me out.",
        "I didn’t sleep all last night because I had discharged a\r\ngood Socialist!”\r\n\r\nSo, after that, Jurgis was known to his “boss” as “Comrade Jurgis,” and\r\nin return he was expected to call him “Comrade Hinds.” “Tommy” Hinds,\r\nas he was known to his intimates, was a squat little man, with broad\r\nshoulders and a florid face, decorated with gray side whiskers.",
        "He was\r\nthe kindest-hearted man that ever lived, and the\r\nliveliest—inexhaustible in his enthusiasm, and talking Socialism all\r\nday and all night.",
        "He was a great fellow to jolly along a crowd, and\r\nwould keep a meeting in an uproar; when once he got really waked up,\r\nthe torrent of his eloquence could be compared with nothing save\r\nNiagara.",
        "Tommy Hinds had begun life as a blacksmith’s helper, and had run away\r\nto join the Union army, where he had made his first acquaintance with\r\n“graft,” in the shape of rotten muskets and shoddy blankets.",
        "To a\r\nmusket that broke in a crisis he always attributed the death of his\r\nonly brother, and upon worthless blankets he blamed all the agonies of\r\nhis own old age.",
        "Whenever it rained, the rheumatism would get into his\r\njoints, and then he would screw up his face and mutter: “Capitalism, my\r\nboy, capitalism!",
        "‘_Écrasez l’Infâme!_’” He had one unfailing remedy for\r\nall the evils of this world, and he preached it to every one; no matter\r\nwhether the person’s trouble was failure in business, or dyspepsia, or\r\na quarrelsome mother-in-law, a twinkle would come into his eyes and he\r\nwould say, “You know what to do about it—vote the Socialist ticket!”\r\n\r\nTommy Hinds had set out upon the trail of the Octopus as soon as the\r\nwar was over.",
        "He had gone into business, and found himself in\r\ncompetition with the fortunes of those who had been stealing while he\r\nhad been fighting.",
        "The city government was in their hands and the\r\nrailroads were in league with them, and honest business was driven to\r\nthe wall; and so Hinds had put all his savings into Chicago real\r\nestate, and set out singlehanded to dam the river of graft.",
        "He had been\r\na reform member of the city council, he had been a Greenbacker, a Labor\r\nUnionist, a Populist, a Bryanite—and after thirty years of fighting,\r\nthe year 1896 had served to convince him that the power of concentrated\r\nwealth could never be controlled, but could only be destroyed.",
        "He had\r\npublished a pamphlet about it, and set out to organize a party of his\r\nown, when a stray Socialist leaflet had revealed to him that others had\r\nbeen ahead of him.",
        "Now for eight years he had been fighting for the\r\nparty, anywhere, everywhere—whether it was a G.A.R.",
        "reunion, or a\r\nhotel-keepers’ convention, or an Afro-American business-men’s banquet,\r\nor a Bible society picnic, Tommy Hinds would manage to get himself\r\ninvited to explain the relations of Socialism to the subject in hand.",
        "After that he would start off upon a tour of his own, ending at some\r\nplace between New York and Oregon; and when he came back from there, he\r\nwould go out to organize new locals for the state committee; and\r\nfinally he would come home to rest—and talk Socialism in Chicago.",
        "Hinds’s hotel was a very hot-bed of the propaganda; all the employees\r\nwere party men, and if they were not when they came, they were quite\r\ncertain to be before they went away.",
        "The proprietor would get into a\r\ndiscussion with some one in the lobby, and as the conversation grew\r\nanimated, others would gather about to listen, until finally every one\r\nin the place would be crowded into a group, and a regular debate would\r\nbe under way.",
        "This went on every night—when Tommy Hinds was not there\r\nto do it, his clerk did it; and when his clerk was away campaigning,\r\nthe assistant attended to it, while Mrs.",
        "Hinds sat behind the desk and\r\ndid the work.",
        "The clerk was an old crony of the proprietor’s, an\r\nawkward, rawboned giant of a man, with a lean, sallow face, a broad\r\nmouth, and whiskers under his chin, the very type and body of a prairie\r\nfarmer.",
        "He had been that all his life—he had fought the railroads in\r\nKansas for fifty years, a Granger, a Farmers’ Alliance man, a\r\n“middle-of-the-road” Populist.",
        "Finally, Tommy Hinds had revealed to him\r\nthe wonderful idea of using the trusts instead of destroying them, and\r\nhe had sold his farm and come to Chicago.",
        "That was Amos Struver; and then there was Harry Adams, the assistant\r\nclerk, a pale, scholarly-looking man, who came from Massachusetts, of\r\nPilgrim stock.",
        "Adams had been a cotton operative in Fall River, and the\r\ncontinued depression in the industry had worn him and his family out,\r\nand he had emigrated to South Carolina.",
        "In Massachusetts the percentage\r\nof white illiteracy is eight-tenths of one per cent, while in South\r\nCarolina it is thirteen and six-tenths per cent; also in South Carolina\r\nthere is a property qualification for voters—and for these and other\r\nreasons child labor is the rule, and so the cotton mills were driving\r\nthose of Massachusetts out of the business.",
        "Adams did not know this, he\r\nonly knew that the Southern mills were running; but when he got there\r\nhe found that if he was to live, all his family would have to work, and\r\nfrom six o’clock at night to six o’clock in the morning.",
        "So he had set\r\nto work to organize the mill hands, after the fashion in Massachusetts,\r\nand had been discharged; but he had gotten other work, and stuck at it,\r\nand at last there had been a strike for shorter hours, and Harry Adams\r\nhad attempted to address a street meeting, which was the end of him.",
        "In\r\nthe states of the far South the labor of convicts is leased to\r\ncontractors, and when there are not convicts enough they have to be\r\nsupplied.",
        "Harry Adams was sent up by a judge who was a cousin of the\r\nmill owner with whose business he had interfered; and though the life\r\nhad nearly killed him, he had been wise enough not to murmur, and at\r\nthe end of his term he and his family had left the state of South\r\nCarolina—hell’s back yard, as he called it.",
        "He had no money for\r\ncarfare, but it was harvest-time, and they walked one day and worked\r\nthe next; and so Adams got at last to Chicago, and joined the Socialist\r\nparty.",
        "He was a studious man, reserved, and nothing of an orator; but\r\nhe always had a pile of books under his desk in the hotel, and articles\r\nfrom his pen were beginning to attract attention in the party press.",
        "Contrary to what one would have expected, all this radicalism did not\r\nhurt the hotel business; the radicals flocked to it, and the commercial\r\ntravelers all found it diverting.",
        "Of late, also, the hotel had become a\r\nfavorite stopping place for Western cattlemen.",
        "Now that the Beef Trust\r\nhad adopted the trick of raising prices to induce enormous shipments of\r\ncattle, and then dropping them again and scooping in all they needed, a\r\nstock raiser was very apt to find himself in Chicago without money\r\nenough to pay his freight bill; and so he had to go to a cheap hotel,\r\nand it was no drawback to him if there was an agitator talking in the\r\nlobby.",
        "These Western fellows were just “meat” for Tommy Hinds—he would\r\nget a dozen of them around him and paint little pictures of “the\r\nSystem.” Of course, it was not a week before he had heard Jurgis’s\r\nstory, and after that he would not have let his new porter go for the\r\nworld.",
        "“See here,” he would say, in the middle of an argument, “I’ve\r\ngot a fellow right here in my place who’s worked there and seen every\r\nbit of it!” And then Jurgis would drop his work, whatever it was, and\r\ncome, and the other would say, “Comrade Jurgis, just tell these\r\ngentlemen what you saw on the killing-beds.” At first this request\r\ncaused poor Jurgis the most acute agony, and it was like pulling teeth\r\nto get him to talk; but gradually he found out what was wanted, and in\r\nthe end he learned to stand up and speak his piece with enthusiasm.",
        "His\r\nemployer would sit by and encourage him with exclamations and shakes of\r\nthe head; when Jurgis would give the formula for “potted ham,” or tell\r\nabout the condemned hogs that were dropped into the “destructors” at\r\nthe top and immediately taken out again at the bottom, to be shipped\r\ninto another state and made into lard, Tommy Hinds would bang his knee\r\nand cry, “Do you think a man could make up a thing like that out of his\r\nhead?”\r\n\r\nAnd then the hotel-keeper would go on to show how the Socialists had\r\nthe only real remedy for such evils, how they alone “meant business”\r\nwith the Beef Trust.",
        "And when, in answer to this, the victim would say\r\nthat the whole country was getting stirred up, that the newspapers were\r\nfull of denunciations of it, and the government taking action against\r\nit, Tommy Hinds had a knock-out blow all ready.",
        "“Yes,” he would say,\r\n“all that is true—but what do you suppose is the reason for it?",
        "Are you\r\nfoolish enough to believe that it’s done for the public?",
        "There are\r\nother trusts in the country just as illegal and extortionate as the\r\nBeef Trust: there is the Coal Trust, that freezes the poor in\r\nwinter—there is the Steel Trust, that doubles the price of every nail\r\nin your shoes—there is the Oil Trust, that keeps you from reading at\r\nnight—and why do you suppose it is that all the fury of the press and\r\nthe government is directed against the Beef Trust?” And when to this\r\nthe victim would reply that there was clamor enough over the Oil Trust,\r\nthe other would continue: “Ten years ago Henry D.",
        "Lloyd told all the\r\ntruth about the Standard Oil Company in his Wealth versus Commonwealth;\r\nand the book was allowed to die, and you hardly ever hear of it.",
        "And\r\nnow, at last, two magazines have the courage to tackle ‘Standard Oil’\r\nagain, and what happens?",
        "The newspapers ridicule the authors, the\r\nchurches defend the criminals, and the government—does nothing.",
        "And\r\nnow, why is it all so different with the Beef Trust?”\r\n\r\nHere the other would generally admit that he was “stuck”; and Tommy\r\nHinds would explain to him, and it was fun to see his eyes open.",
        "“If\r\nyou were a Socialist,” the hotel-keeper would say, “you would\r\nunderstand that the power which really governs the United States today\r\nis the Railroad Trust.",
        "It is the Railroad Trust that runs your state\r\ngovernment, wherever you live, and that runs the United States Senate.",
        "And all of the trusts that I have named are railroad trusts—save only\r\nthe Beef Trust!",
        "The Beef Trust has defied the railroads—it is\r\nplundering them day by day through the Private Car; and so the public\r\nis roused to fury, and the papers clamor for action, and the government\r\ngoes on the war-path!",
        "And you poor common people watch and applaud the\r\njob, and think it’s all done for you, and never dream that it is really\r\nthe grand climax of the century-long battle of commercial\r\ncompetition—the final death grapple between the chiefs of the Beef\r\nTrust and ‘Standard Oil,’ for the prize of the mastery and ownership of\r\nthe United States of America!”\r\n\r\nSuch was the new home in which Jurgis lived and worked, and in which\r\nhis education was completed.",
        "Perhaps you would imagine that he did not\r\ndo much work there, but that would be a great mistake.",
        "He would have\r\ncut off one hand for Tommy Hinds; and to keep Hinds’s hotel a thing of\r\nbeauty was his joy in life.",
        "That he had a score of Socialist arguments\r\nchasing through his brain in the meantime did not interfere with this;\r\non the contrary, Jurgis scrubbed the spittoons and polished the\r\nbanisters all the more vehemently because at the same time he was\r\nwrestling inwardly with an imaginary recalcitrant.",
        "It would be pleasant\r\nto record that he swore off drinking immediately, and all the rest of\r\nhis bad habits with it; but that would hardly be exact.",
        "These\r\nrevolutionists were not angels; they were men, and men who had come up\r\nfrom the social pit, and with the mire of it smeared over them.",
        "Some of\r\nthem drank, and some of them swore, and some of them ate pie with their\r\nknives; there was only one difference between them and all the rest of\r\nthe populace—that they were men with a hope, with a cause to fight for\r\nand suffer for.",
        "There came times to Jurgis when the vision seemed\r\nfar-off and pale, and a glass of beer loomed large in comparison; but\r\nif the glass led to another glass, and to too many glasses, he had\r\nsomething to spur him to remorse and resolution on the morrow.",
        "It was\r\nso evidently a wicked thing to spend one’s pennies for drink, when the\r\nworking class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered;\r\nthe price of a glass of beer would buy fifty copies of a leaflet, and\r\none could hand these out to the unregenerate, and then get drunk upon\r\nthe thought of the good that was being accomplished.",
        "That was the way\r\nthe movement had been made, and it was the only way it would progress;\r\nit availed nothing to know of it, without fighting for it—it was a\r\nthing for all, not for a few!",
        "A corollary of this proposition of course\r\nwas, that any one who refused to receive the new gospel was personally\r\nresponsible for keeping Jurgis from his heart’s desire; and this, alas,\r\nmade him uncomfortable as an acquaintance.",
        "He met some neighbors with\r\nwhom Elzbieta had made friends in her neighborhood, and he set out to\r\nmake Socialists of them by wholesale, and several times he all but got\r\ninto a fight.",
        "It was all so painfully obvious to Jurgis!",
        "It was so incomprehensible\r\nhow a man could fail to see it!",
        "Here were all the opportunities of the\r\ncountry, the land, and the buildings upon the land, the railroads, the\r\nmines, the factories, and the stores, all in the hands of a few private\r\nindividuals, called capitalists, for whom the people were obliged to\r\nwork for wages.",
        "The whole balance of what the people produced went to\r\nheap up the fortunes of these capitalists, to heap, and heap again, and\r\nyet again—and that in spite of the fact that they, and every one about\r\nthem, lived in unthinkable luxury!",
        "And was it not plain that if the\r\npeople cut off the share of those who merely “owned,” the share of\r\nthose who worked would be much greater?",
        "That was as plain as two and\r\ntwo makes four; and it was the whole of it, absolutely the whole of it;\r\nand yet there were people who could not see it, who would argue about\r\neverything else in the world.",
        "They would tell you that governments\r\ncould not manage things as economically as private individuals; they\r\nwould repeat and repeat that, and think they were saying something!",
        "They could not see that “economical” management by masters meant simply\r\nthat they, the people, were worked harder and ground closer and paid\r\nless!",
        "They were wage-earners and servants, at the mercy of exploiters\r\nwhose one thought was to get as much out of them as possible; and they\r\nwere taking an interest in the process, were anxious lest it should not\r\nbe done thoroughly enough!",
        "Was it not honestly a trial to listen to an\r\nargument such as that?",
        "And yet there were things even worse.",
        "You would begin talking to some\r\npoor devil who had worked in one shop for the last thirty years, and\r\nhad never been able to save a penny; who left home every morning at six\r\no’clock, to go and tend a machine, and come back at night too tired to\r\ntake his clothes off; who had never had a week’s vacation in his life,\r\nhad never traveled, never had an adventure, never learned anything,\r\nnever hoped anything—and when you started to tell him about Socialism\r\nhe would sniff and say, “I’m not interested in that—I’m an\r\nindividualist!” And then he would go on to tell you that Socialism was\r\n“paternalism,” and that if it ever had its way the world would stop\r\nprogressing.",
        "It was enough to make a mule laugh, to hear arguments like\r\nthat; and yet it was no laughing matter, as you found out—for how many\r\nmillions of such poor deluded wretches there were, whose lives had been\r\nso stunted by capitalism that they no longer knew what freedom was!",
        "And\r\nthey really thought that it was “individualism” for tens of thousands\r\nof them to herd together and obey the orders of a steel magnate, and\r\nproduce hundreds of millions of dollars of wealth for him, and then let\r\nhim give them libraries; while for them to take the industry, and run\r\nit to suit themselves, and build their own libraries—that would have\r\nbeen “Paternalism”!",
        "Sometimes the agony of such things as this was almost more than Jurgis\r\ncould bear; yet there was no way of escape from it, there was nothing\r\nto do but to dig away at the base of this mountain of ignorance and\r\nprejudice.",
        "You must keep at the poor fellow; you must hold your temper,\r\nand argue with him, and watch for your chance to stick an idea or two\r\ninto his head.",
        "And the rest of the time you must sharpen up your\r\nweapons—you must think out new replies to his objections, and provide\r\nyourself with new facts to prove to him the folly of his ways.",
        "So Jurgis acquired the reading habit.",
        "He would carry in his pocket a\r\ntract or a pamphlet which some one had loaned him, and whenever he had\r\nan idle moment during the day he would plod through a paragraph, and\r\nthen think about it while he worked.",
        "Also he read the newspapers, and\r\nasked questions about them.",
        "One of the other porters at Hinds’s was a\r\nsharp little Irishman, who knew everything that Jurgis wanted to know;\r\nand while they were busy he would explain to him the geography of\r\nAmerica, and its history, its constitution and its laws; also he gave\r\nhim an idea of the business system of the country, the great railroads\r\nand corporations, and who owned them, and the labor unions, and the big\r\nstrikes, and the men who had led them.",
        "Then at night, when he could get\r\noff, Jurgis would attend the Socialist meetings.",
        "During the campaign\r\none was not dependent upon the street corner affairs, where the weather\r\nand the quality of the orator were equally uncertain; there were hall\r\nmeetings every night, and one could hear speakers of national\r\nprominence.",
        "These discussed the political situation from every point of\r\nview, and all that troubled Jurgis was the impossibility of carrying\r\noff but a small part of the treasures they offered him.",
        "There was a man who was known in the party as the “Little Giant.” The\r\nLord had used up so much material in the making of his head that there\r\nhad not been enough to complete his legs; but he got about on the\r\nplatform, and when he shook his raven whiskers the pillars of\r\ncapitalism rocked.",
        "He had written a veritable encyclopedia upon the\r\nsubject, a book that was nearly as big as himself—And then there was a\r\nyoung author, who came from California, and had been a salmon fisher,\r\nan oyster-pirate, a longshoreman, a sailor; who had tramped the country\r\nand been sent to jail, had lived in the Whitechapel slums, and been to\r\nthe Klondike in search of gold.",
        "All these things he pictured in his\r\nbooks, and because he was a man of genius he forced the world to hear\r\nhim.",
        "Now he was famous, but wherever he went he still preached the\r\ngospel of the poor.",
        "And then there was one who was known at the\r\n“millionaire Socialist.” He had made a fortune in business, and spent\r\nnearly all of it in building up a magazine, which the post office\r\ndepartment had tried to suppress, and had driven to Canada.",
        "He was a\r\nquiet-mannered man, whom you would have taken for anything in the world\r\nbut a Socialist agitator.",
        "His speech was simple and informal—he could\r\nnot understand why any one should get excited about these things.",
        "It\r\nwas a process of economic evolution, he said, and he exhibited its laws\r\nand methods.",
        "Life was a struggle for existence, and the strong overcame\r\nthe weak, and in turn were overcome by the strongest.",
        "Those who lost in\r\nthe struggle were generally exterminated; but now and then they had\r\nbeen known to save themselves by combination—which was a new and higher\r\nkind of strength.",
        "It was so that the gregarious animals had overcome\r\nthe predaceous; it was so, in human history, that the people had\r\nmastered the kings.",
        "The workers were simply the citizens of industry,\r\nand the Socialist movement was the expression of their will to survive.",
        "The inevitability of the revolution depended upon this fact, that they\r\nhad no choice but to unite or be exterminated; this fact, grim and\r\ninexorable, depended upon no human will, it was the law of the economic\r\nprocess, of which the editor showed the details with the most marvelous\r\nprecision.",
        "And later on came the evening of the great meeting of the campaign,\r\nwhen Jurgis heard the two standard-bearers of his party.",
        "Ten years\r\nbefore there had been in Chicago a strike of a hundred and fifty\r\nthousand railroad employees, and thugs had been hired by the railroads\r\nto commit violence, and the President of the United States had sent in\r\ntroops to break the strike, by flinging the officers of the union into\r\njail without trial.",
        "The president of the union came out of his cell a\r\nruined man; but also he came out a Socialist; and now for just ten\r\nyears he had been traveling up and down the country, standing face to\r\nface with the people, and pleading with them for justice.",
        "He was a man\r\nof electric presence, tall and gaunt, with a face worn thin by struggle\r\nand suffering.",
        "The fury of outraged manhood gleamed in it—and the tears\r\nof suffering little children pleaded in his voice.",
        "When he spoke he\r\npaced the stage, lithe and eager, like a panther.",
        "He leaned over,\r\nreaching out for his audience; he pointed into their souls with an\r\ninsistent finger.",
        "His voice was husky from much speaking, but the great\r\nauditorium was as still as death, and every one heard him.",
        "And then, as Jurgis came out from this meeting, some one handed him a\r\npaper which he carried home with him and read; and so he became\r\nacquainted with the “Appeal to Reason.” About twelve years previously a\r\nColorado real-estate speculator had made up his mind that it was wrong\r\nto gamble in the necessities of life of human beings: and so he had\r\nretired and begun the publication of a Socialist weekly.",
        "There had come\r\na time when he had to set his own type, but he had held on and won out,\r\nand now his publication was an institution.",
        "It used a carload of paper\r\nevery week, and the mail trains would be hours loading up at the depot\r\nof the little Kansas town.",
        "It was a four-page weekly, which sold for\r\nless than half a cent a copy; its regular subscription list was a\r\nquarter of a million, and it went to every crossroads post office in\r\nAmerica.",
        "The “Appeal” was a “propaganda” paper.",
        "It had a manner all its own—it\r\nwas full of ginger and spice, of Western slang and hustle: It collected\r\nnews of the doings of the “plutes,” and served it up for the benefit of\r\nthe “American working-mule.” It would have columns of the deadly\r\nparallel—the million dollars’ worth of diamonds, or the fancy\r\npet-poodle establishment of a society dame, beside the fate of Mrs.",
        "Murphy of San Francisco, who had starved to death on the streets, or of\r\nJohn Robinson, just out of the hospital, who had hanged himself in New\r\nYork because he could not find work.",
        "It collected the stories of graft\r\nand misery from the daily press, and made a little pungent paragraphs\r\nout of them.",
        "“Three banks of Bungtown, South Dakota, failed, and more\r\nsavings of the workers swallowed up!” “The mayor of Sandy Creek,\r\nOklahoma, has skipped with a hundred thousand dollars.",
        "That’s the kind\r\nof rulers the old partyites give you!” “The president of the Florida\r\nFlying Machine Company is in jail for bigamy.",
        "He was a prominent\r\nopponent of Socialism, which he said would break up the home!” The\r\n“Appeal” had what it called its “Army,” about thirty thousand of the\r\nfaithful, who did things for it; and it was always exhorting the “Army”\r\nto keep its dander up, and occasionally encouraging it with a prize\r\ncompetition, for anything from a gold watch to a private yacht or an\r\neighty-acre farm.",
        "Its office helpers were all known to the “Army” by\r\nquaint titles—“Inky Ike,” “the Bald-headed Man,” “the Redheaded Girl,”\r\n“the Bulldog,” “the Office Goat,” and “the One Hoss.”\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, again, the “Appeal” would be desperately serious.",
        "It\r\nsent a correspondent to Colorado, and printed pages describing the\r\noverthrow of American institutions in that state.",
        "In a certain city of\r\nthe country it had over forty of its “Army” in the headquarters of the\r\nTelegraph Trust, and no message of importance to Socialists ever went\r\nthrough that a copy of it did not go to the “Appeal.” It would print\r\ngreat broadsides during the campaign; one copy that came to Jurgis was\r\na manifesto addressed to striking workingmen, of which nearly a million\r\ncopies had been distributed in the industrial centers, wherever the\r\nemployers’ associations had been carrying out their “open shop”\r\nprogram.",
        "“You have lost the strike!” it was headed.",
        "“And now what are\r\nyou going to do about it?” It was what is called an “incendiary”\r\nappeal—it was written by a man into whose soul the iron had entered.",
        "When this edition appeared, twenty thousand copies were sent to the\r\nstockyards district; and they were taken out and stowed away in the\r\nrear of a little cigar store, and every evening, and on Sundays, the\r\nmembers of the Packingtown locals would get armfuls and distribute them\r\non the streets and in the houses.",
        "The people of Packingtown had lost\r\ntheir strike, if ever a people had, and so they read these papers\r\ngladly, and twenty thousand were hardly enough to go round.",
        "Jurgis had\r\nresolved not to go near his old home again, but when he heard of this\r\nit was too much for him, and every night for a week he would get on the\r\ncar and ride out to the stockyards, and help to undo his work of the\r\nprevious year, when he had sent Mike Scully’s ten-pin setter to the\r\ncity Board of Aldermen.",
        "It was quite marvelous to see what a difference twelve months had made\r\nin Packingtown—the eyes of the people were getting opened!",
        "The\r\nSocialists were literally sweeping everything before them that\r\nelection, and Scully and the Cook County machine were at their wits’\r\nend for an “issue.” At the very close of the campaign they bethought\r\nthemselves of the fact that the strike had been broken by Negroes, and\r\nso they sent for a South Carolina fire-eater, the “pitchfork senator,”\r\nas he was called, a man who took off his coat when he talked to\r\nworkingmen, and damned and swore like a Hessian.",
        "This meeting they\r\nadvertised extensively, and the Socialists advertised it too—with the\r\nresult that about a thousand of them were on hand that evening.",
        "The\r\n“pitchfork senator” stood their fusillade of questions for about an\r\nhour, and then went home in disgust, and the balance of the meeting was\r\na strictly party affair.",
        "Jurgis, who had insisted upon coming, had the\r\ntime of his life that night; he danced about and waved his arms in his\r\nexcitement—and at the very climax he broke loose from his friends, and\r\ngot out into the aisle, and proceeded to make a speech himself!",
        "The\r\nsenator had been denying that the Democratic party was corrupt; it was\r\nalways the Republicans who bought the votes, he said—and here was\r\nJurgis shouting furiously, “It’s a lie!",
        "It’s a lie!” After which he\r\nwent on to tell them how he knew it—that he knew it because he had\r\nbought them himself!",
        "And he would have told the “pitchfork senator” all\r\nhis experiences, had not Harry Adams and a friend grabbed him about the\r\nneck and shoved him into a seat.",
        "CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first things that Jurgis had done after he got a job was to\r\ngo and see Marija.",
        "She came down into the basement of the house to meet\r\nhim, and he stood by the door with his hat in his hand, saying, “I’ve\r\ngot work now, and so you can leave here.”\r\n\r\nBut Marija only shook her head.",
        "There was nothing else for her to do,\r\nshe said, and nobody to employ her.",
        "She could not keep her past a\r\nsecret—girls had tried it, and they were always found out.",
        "There were\r\nthousands of men who came to this place, and sooner or later she would\r\nmeet one of them.",
        "“And besides,” Marija added, “I can’t do anything.",
        "I’m no good—I take dope.",
        "What could you do with me?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you stop?” Jurgis cried.",
        "“No,” she answered, “I’ll never stop.",
        "What’s the use of talking about\r\nit—I’ll stay here till I die, I guess.",
        "It’s all I’m fit for.” And that\r\nwas all that he could get her to say—there was no use trying.",
        "When he\r\ntold her he would not let Elzbieta take her money, she answered\r\nindifferently: “Then it’ll be wasted here—that’s all.” Her eyelids\r\nlooked heavy and her face was red and swollen; he saw that he was\r\nannoying her, that she only wanted him to go away.",
        "So he went,\r\ndisappointed and sad.",
        "Poor Jurgis was not very happy in his home-life.",
        "Elzbieta was sick a\r\ngood deal now, and the boys were wild and unruly, and very much the\r\nworse for their life upon the streets.",
        "But he stuck by the family\r\nnevertheless, for they reminded him of his old happiness; and when\r\nthings went wrong he could solace himself with a plunge into the\r\nSocialist movement.",
        "Since his life had been caught up into the current\r\nof this great stream, things which had before been the whole of life to\r\nhim came to seem of relatively slight importance; his interests were\r\nelsewhere, in the world of ideas.",
        "His outward life was commonplace and\r\nuninteresting; he was just a hotel-porter, and expected to remain one\r\nwhile he lived; but meantime, in the realm of thought, his life was a\r\nperpetual adventure.",
        "There was so much to know—so many wonders to be\r\ndiscovered!",
        "Never in all his life did Jurgis forget the day before\r\nelection, when there came a telephone message from a friend of Harry\r\nAdams, asking him to bring Jurgis to see him that night; and Jurgis\r\nwent, and met one of the minds of the movement.",
        "The invitation was from a man named Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who\r\nhad given up his life to settlement work, and had a little home in the\r\nheart of the city’s slums.",
        "He did not belong to the party, but he was\r\nin sympathy with it; and he said that he was to have as his guest that\r\nnight the editor of a big Eastern magazine, who wrote against\r\nSocialism, but really did not know what it was.",
        "The millionaire\r\nsuggested that Adams bring Jurgis along, and then start up the subject\r\nof “pure food,” in which the editor was interested.",
        "Young Fisher’s home was a little two-story brick house, dingy and\r\nweather-beaten outside, but attractive within.",
        "The room that Jurgis saw\r\nwas half lined with books, and upon the walls were many pictures, dimly\r\nvisible in the soft, yellow light; it was a cold, rainy night, so a log\r\nfire was crackling in the open hearth.",
        "Seven or eight people were\r\ngathered about it when Adams and his friend arrived, and Jurgis saw to\r\nhis dismay that three of them were ladies.",
        "He had never talked to\r\npeople of this sort before, and he fell into an agony of embarrassment.",
        "He stood in the doorway clutching his hat tightly in his hands, and\r\nmade a deep bow to each of the persons as he was introduced; then, when\r\nhe was asked to have a seat, he took a chair in a dark corner, and sat\r\ndown upon the edge of it, and wiped the perspiration off his forehead\r\nwith his sleeve.",
        "He was terrified lest they should expect him to talk.",
        "There was the host himself, a tall, athletic young man, clad in evening\r\ndress, as also was the editor, a dyspeptic-looking gentleman named\r\nMaynard.",
        "There was the former’s frail young wife, and also an elderly\r\nlady, who taught kindergarten in the settlement, and a young college\r\nstudent, a beautiful girl with an intense and earnest face.",
        "She only\r\nspoke once or twice while Jurgis was there—the rest of the time she sat\r\nby the table in the center of the room, resting her chin in her hands\r\nand drinking in the conversation.",
        "There were two other men, whom young\r\nFisher had introduced to Jurgis as Mr.",
        "Lucas and Mr.",
        "Schliemann; he\r\nheard them address Adams as “Comrade,” and so he knew that they were\r\nSocialists.",
        "The one called Lucas was a mild and meek-looking little gentleman of\r\nclerical aspect; he had been an itinerant evangelist, it transpired,\r\nand had seen the light and become a prophet of the new dispensation.",
        "He\r\ntraveled all over the country, living like the apostles of old, upon\r\nhospitality, and preaching upon street-corners when there was no hall.",
        "The other man had been in the midst of a discussion with the editor\r\nwhen Adams and Jurgis came in; and at the suggestion of the host they\r\nresumed it after the interruption.",
        "Jurgis was soon sitting spellbound,\r\nthinking that here was surely the strangest man that had ever lived in\r\nthe world.",
        "Nicholas Schliemann was a Swede, a tall, gaunt person, with hairy hands\r\nand bristling yellow beard; he was a university man, and had been a\r\nprofessor of philosophy—until, as he said, he had found that he was\r\nselling his character as well as his time.",
        "Instead he had come to\r\nAmerica, where he lived in a garret room in this slum district, and\r\nmade volcanic energy take the place of fire.",
        "He studied the composition\r\nof food-stuffs, and knew exactly how many proteids and carbohydrates\r\nhis body needed; and by scientific chewing he said that he tripled the\r\nvalue of all he ate, so that it cost him eleven cents a day.",
        "About the\r\nfirst of July he would leave Chicago for his vacation, on foot; and\r\nwhen he struck the harvest fields he would set to work for two dollars\r\nand a half a day, and come home when he had another year’s supply—a\r\nhundred and twenty-five dollars.",
        "That was the nearest approach to\r\nindependence a man could make “under capitalism,” he explained; he\r\nwould never marry, for no sane man would allow himself to fall in love\r\nuntil after the revolution.",
        "He sat in a big arm-chair, with his legs crossed, and his head so far\r\nin the shadow that one saw only two glowing lights, reflected from the\r\nfire on the hearth.",
        "He spoke simply, and utterly without emotion; with\r\nthe manner of a teacher setting forth to a group of scholars an axiom\r\nin geometry, he would enunciate such propositions as made the hair of\r\nan ordinary person rise on end.",
        "And when the auditor had asserted his\r\nnon-comprehension, he would proceed to elucidate by some new\r\nproposition, yet more appalling.",
        "To Jurgis the Herr Dr.",
        "Schliemann\r\nassumed the proportions of a thunderstorm or an earthquake.",
        "And yet,\r\nstrange as it might seem, there was a subtle bond between them, and he\r\ncould follow the argument nearly all the time.",
        "He was carried over the\r\ndifficult places in spite of himself; and he went plunging away in mad\r\ncareer—a very Mazeppa-ride upon the wild horse Speculation.",
        "Nicholas Schliemann was familiar with all the universe, and with man as\r\na small part of it.",
        "He understood human institutions, and blew them\r\nabout like soap bubbles.",
        "It was surprising that so much destructiveness\r\ncould be contained in one human mind.",
        "Was it government?",
        "The purpose of\r\ngovernment was the guarding of property-rights, the perpetuation of\r\nancient force and modern fraud.",
        "Or was it marriage?",
        "Marriage and\r\nprostitution were two sides of one shield, the predatory man’s\r\nexploitation of the sex-pleasure.",
        "The difference between them was a\r\ndifference of class.",
        "If a woman had money she might dictate her own\r\nterms: equality, a life contract, and the legitimacy—that is, the\r\nproperty-rights—of her children.",
        "If she had no money, she was a\r\nproletarian, and sold herself for an existence.",
        "And then the subject\r\nbecame Religion, which was the Archfiend’s deadliest weapon.",
        "Government\r\noppressed the body of the wage-slave, but Religion oppressed his mind,\r\nand poisoned the stream of progress at its source.",
        "The working-man was\r\nto fix his hopes upon a future life, while his pockets were picked in\r\nthis one; he was brought up to frugality, humility, obedience—in short\r\nto all the pseudo-virtues of capitalism.",
        "The destiny of civilization\r\nwould be decided in one final death struggle between the Red\r\nInternational and the Black, between Socialism and the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch; while here at home, “the stygian midnight of American\r\nevangelicalism—”\r\n\r\nAnd here the ex-preacher entered the field, and there was a lively\r\ntussle.",
        "“Comrade” Lucas was not what is called an educated man; he knew\r\nonly the Bible, but it was the Bible interpreted by real experience.",
        "And what was the use, he asked, of confusing Religion with men’s\r\nperversions of it?",
        "That the church was in the hands of the merchants at\r\nthe moment was obvious enough; but already there were signs of\r\nrebellion, and if Comrade Schliemann could come back a few years from\r\nnow—\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” said the other, “of course, I have no doubt that in a\r\nhundred years the Vatican will be denying that it ever opposed\r\nSocialism, just as at present it denies that it ever tortured Galileo.”\r\n\r\n“I am not defending the Vatican,” exclaimed Lucas, vehemently.",
        "“I am\r\ndefending the word of God—which is one long cry of the human spirit for\r\ndeliverance from the sway of oppression.",
        "Take the twenty-fourth chapter\r\nof the Book of Job, which I am accustomed to quote in my addresses as\r\n‘the Bible upon the Beef Trust’; or take the words of Isaiah—or of the\r\nMaster himself!",
        "Not the elegant prince of our debauched and vicious\r\nart, not the jeweled idol of our society churches—but the Jesus of the\r\nawful reality, the man of sorrow and pain, the outcast, despised of the\r\nworld, who had nowhere to lay his head—”\r\n\r\n“I will grant you Jesus,” interrupted the other.",
        "“Well, then,” cried Lucas, “and why should Jesus have nothing to do\r\nwith his church—why should his words and his life be of no authority\r\namong those who profess to adore him?",
        "Here is a man who was the world’s\r\nfirst revolutionist, the true founder of the Socialist movement; a man\r\nwhose whole being was one flame of hatred for wealth, and all that\r\nwealth stands for,—for the pride of wealth, and the luxury of wealth,\r\nand the tyranny of wealth; who was himself a beggar and a tramp, a man\r\nof the people, an associate of saloon-keepers and women of the town;\r\nwho again and again, in the most explicit language, denounced wealth\r\nand the holding of wealth: ‘Lay not up for yourselves treasures on\r\nearth!’—‘Sell that ye have and give alms!’—‘Blessed are ye poor, for\r\nyours is the kingdom of Heaven!’—‘Woe unto you that are rich, for ye\r\nhave received your consolation!’—‘Verily, I say unto you, that a rich\r\nman shall hardly enter into the kingdom of Heaven!’ Who denounced in\r\nunmeasured terms the exploiters of his own time: ‘Woe unto you, scribes\r\nand pharisees, hypocrites!’—‘Woe unto you also, you lawyers!’—‘Ye\r\nserpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of\r\nhell?’ Who drove out the business men and brokers from the temple with\r\na whip!",
        "Who was crucified—think of it—for an incendiary and a disturber\r\nof the social order!",
        "And this man they have made into the high priest\r\nof property and smug respectability, a divine sanction of all the\r\nhorrors and abominations of modern commercial civilization!",
        "Jeweled\r\nimages are made of him, sensual priests burn incense to him, and modern\r\npirates of industry bring their dollars, wrung from the toil of\r\nhelpless women and children, and build temples to him, and sit in\r\ncushioned seats and listen to his teachings expounded by doctors of\r\ndusty divinity—”\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” cried Schliemann, laughing.",
        "But the other was in full\r\ncareer—he had talked this subject every day for five years, and had\r\nnever yet let himself be stopped.",
        "“This Jesus of Nazareth!” he cried.",
        "“This class-conscious working-man!",
        "This union carpenter!",
        "This agitator,\r\nlaw-breaker, firebrand, anarchist!",
        "He, the sovereign lord and master of\r\na world which grinds the bodies and souls of human beings into\r\ndollars—if he could come into the world this day and see the things\r\nthat men have made in his name, would it not blast his soul with\r\nhorror?",
        "Would he not go mad at the sight of it, he the Prince of Mercy\r\nand Love!",
        "That dreadful night when he lay in the Garden of Gethsemane\r\nand writhed in agony until he sweat blood—do you think that he saw\r\nanything worse than he might see tonight upon the plains of Manchuria,\r\nwhere men march out with a jeweled image of him before them, to do\r\nwholesale murder for the benefit of foul monsters of sensuality and\r\ncruelty?",
        "Do you not know that if he were in St.",
        "Petersburg now, he\r\nwould take the whip with which he drove out the bankers from his\r\ntemple—”\r\n\r\nHere the speaker paused an instant for breath.",
        "“No, comrade,” said the\r\nother, dryly, “for he was a practical man.",
        "He would take pretty little\r\nimitation lemons, such as are now being shipped into Russia, handy for\r\ncarrying in the pockets, and strong enough to blow a whole temple out\r\nof sight.”\r\n\r\nLucas waited until the company had stopped laughing over this; then he\r\nbegan again: “But look at it from the point of view of practical\r\npolitics, comrade.",
        "Here is an historical figure whom all men reverence\r\nand love, whom some regard as divine; and who was one of us—who lived\r\nour life, and taught our doctrine.",
        "And now shall we leave him in the\r\nhands of his enemies—shall we allow them to stifle and stultify his\r\nexample?",
        "We have his words, which no one can deny; and shall we not\r\nquote them to the people, and prove to them what he was, and what he\r\ntaught, and what he did?",
        "No, no, a thousand times no!—we shall use his\r\nauthority to turn out the knaves and sluggards from his ministry, and\r\nwe shall yet rouse the people to action!—”\r\n\r\nLucas halted again; and the other stretched out his hand to a paper on\r\nthe table.",
        "“Here, comrade,” he said, with a laugh, “here is a place for\r\nyou to begin.",
        "A bishop whose wife has just been robbed of fifty\r\nthousand dollars’ worth of diamonds!",
        "And a most unctuous and oily of\r\nbishops!",
        "An eminent and scholarly bishop!",
        "A philanthropist and friend\r\nof labor bishop—a Civic Federation decoy duck for the chloroforming of\r\nthe wage-working-man!”\r\n\r\nTo this little passage of arms the rest of the company sat as\r\nspectators.",
        "But now Mr.",
        "Maynard, the editor, took occasion to remark,\r\nsomewhat naïvely, that he had always understood that Socialists had a\r\ncut-and-dried program for the future of civilization; whereas here were\r\ntwo active members of the party, who, from what he could make out, were\r\nagreed about nothing at all.",
        "Would the two, for his enlightenment, try\r\nto ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the\r\nsame party?",
        "This resulted, after much debating, in the formulating of\r\ntwo carefully worded propositions: First, that a Socialist believes in\r\nthe common ownership and democratic management of the means of\r\nproducing the necessities of life; and, second, that a Socialist\r\nbelieves that the means by which this is to be brought about is the\r\nclass conscious political organization of the wage-earners.",
        "Thus far\r\nthey were at one; but no farther.",
        "To Lucas, the religious zealot, the\r\nco-operative commonwealth was the New Jerusalem, the kingdom of Heaven,\r\nwhich is “within you.” To the other, Socialism was simply a necessary\r\nstep toward a far-distant goal, a step to be tolerated with impatience.",
        "Schliemann called himself a “philosophic anarchist”; and he explained\r\nthat an anarchist was one who believed that the end of human existence\r\nwas the free development of every personality, unrestricted by laws\r\nsave those of its own being.",
        "Since the same kind of match would light\r\nevery one’s fire and the same-shaped loaf of bread would fill every\r\none’s stomach, it would be perfectly feasible to submit industry to the\r\ncontrol of a majority vote.",
        "There was only one earth, and the quantity\r\nof material things was limited.",
        "Of intellectual and moral things, on\r\nthe other hand, there was no limit, and one could have more without\r\nanother’s having less; hence “Communism in material production,\r\nanarchism in intellectual,” was the formula of modern proletarian\r\nthought.",
        "As soon as the birth agony was over, and the wounds of society\r\nhad been healed, there would be established a simple system whereby\r\neach man was credited with his labor and debited with his purchases;\r\nand after that the processes of production, exchange, and consumption\r\nwould go on automatically, and without our being conscious of them, any\r\nmore than a man is conscious of the beating of his heart.",
        "And then,\r\nexplained Schliemann, society would break up into independent,\r\nself-governing communities of mutually congenial persons; examples of\r\nwhich at present were clubs, churches, and political parties.",
        "After the\r\nrevolution, all the intellectual, artistic, and spiritual activities of\r\nmen would be cared for by such “free associations”; romantic novelists\r\nwould be supported by those who liked to read romantic novels, and\r\nimpressionist painters would be supported by those who liked to look at\r\nimpressionist pictures—and the same with preachers and scientists,\r\neditors and actors and musicians.",
        "If any one wanted to work or paint or\r\npray, and could find no one to maintain him, he could support himself\r\nby working part of the time.",
        "That was the case at present, the only\r\ndifference being that the competitive wage system compelled a man to\r\nwork all the time to live, while, after the abolition of privilege and\r\nexploitation, any one would be able to support himself by an hour’s\r\nwork a day.",
        "Also the artist’s audience of the present was a small\r\nminority of people, all debased and vulgarized by the effort it had\r\ncost them to win in the commercial battle, of the intellectual and\r\nartistic activities which would result when the whole of mankind was\r\nset free from the nightmare of competition, we could at present form no\r\nconception whatever.",
        "And then the editor wanted to know upon what ground Dr.",
        "Schliemann\r\nasserted that it might be possible for a society to exist upon an\r\nhour’s toil by each of its members.",
        "“Just what,” answered the other,\r\n“would be the productive capacity of society if the present resources\r\nof science were utilized, we have no means of ascertaining; but we may\r\nbe sure it would exceed anything that would sound reasonable to minds\r\ninured to the ferocious barbarities of capitalism.",
        "After the triumph of\r\nthe international proletariat, war would of course be inconceivable;\r\nand who can figure the cost of war to humanity—not merely the value of\r\nthe lives and the material that it destroys, not merely the cost of\r\nkeeping millions of men in idleness, of arming and equipping them for\r\nbattle and parade, but the drain upon the vital energies of society by\r\nthe war attitude and the war terror, the brutality and ignorance, the\r\ndrunkenness, prostitution, and crime it entails, the industrial\r\nimpotence and the moral deadness?",
        "Do you think that it would be too\r\nmuch to say that two hours of the working time of every efficient\r\nmember of a community goes to feed the red fiend of war?”\r\n\r\nAnd then Schliemann went on to outline some of the wastes of\r\ncompetition: the losses of industrial warfare; the ceaseless worry and\r\nfriction; the vices—such as drink, for instance, the use of which had\r\nnearly doubled in twenty years, as a consequence of the intensification\r\nof the economic struggle; the idle and unproductive members of the\r\ncommunity, the frivolous rich and the pauperized poor; the law and the\r\nwhole machinery of repression; the wastes of social ostentation, the\r\nmilliners and tailors, the hairdressers, dancing masters, chefs and\r\nlackeys.",
        "“You understand,” he said, “that in a society dominated by the\r\nfact of commercial competition, money is necessarily the test of\r\nprowess, and wastefulness the sole criterion of power.",
        "So we have, at\r\nthe present moment, a society with, say, thirty per cent of the\r\npopulation occupied in producing useless articles, and one per cent\r\noccupied in destroying them.",
        "And this is not all; for the servants and\r\npanders of the parasites are also parasites, the milliners and the\r\njewelers and the lackeys have also to be supported by the useful\r\nmembers of the community.",
        "And bear in mind also that this monstrous\r\ndisease affects not merely the idlers and their menials, its poison\r\npenetrates the whole social body.",
        "Beneath the hundred thousand women of\r\nthe elite are a million middle-class women, miserable because they are\r\nnot of the elite, and trying to appear of it in public; and beneath\r\nthem, in turn, are five million farmers’ wives reading ‘fashion papers’\r\nand trimming bonnets, and shop-girls and serving-maids selling\r\nthemselves into brothels for cheap jewelry and imitation seal-skin\r\nrobes.",
        "And then consider that, added to this competition in display,\r\nyou have, like oil on the flames, a whole system of competition in\r\nselling!",
        "You have manufacturers contriving tens of thousands of\r\ncatchpenny devices, storekeepers displaying them, and newspapers and\r\nmagazines filled up with advertisements of them!”\r\n\r\n“And don’t forget the wastes of fraud,” put in young Fisher.",
        "“When one comes to the ultra-modern profession of advertising,”\r\nresponded Schliemann—“the science of persuading people to buy what they\r\ndo not want—he is in the very center of the ghastly charnel house of\r\ncapitalist destructiveness, and he scarcely knows which of a dozen\r\nhorrors to point out first.",
        "But consider the waste in time and energy\r\nincidental to making ten thousand varieties of a thing for purposes of\r\nostentation and snobbishness, where one variety would do for use!",
        "Consider all the waste incidental to the manufacture of cheap qualities\r\nof goods, of goods made to sell and deceive the ignorant; consider the\r\nwastes of adulteration,—the shoddy clothing, the cotton blankets, the\r\nunstable tenements, the ground-cork life-preservers, the adulterated\r\nmilk, the aniline soda water, the potato-flour sausages—”\r\n\r\n“And consider the moral aspects of the thing,” put in the ex-preacher.",
        "“Precisely,” said Schliemann; “the low knavery and the ferocious\r\ncruelty incidental to them, the plotting and the lying and the bribing,\r\nthe blustering and bragging, the screaming egotism, the hurrying and\r\nworrying.",
        "Of course, imitation and adulteration are the essence of\r\ncompetition—they are but another form of the phrase ‘to buy in the\r\ncheapest market and sell in the dearest.’ A government official has\r\nstated that the nation suffers a loss of a billion and a quarter\r\ndollars a year through adulterated foods; which means, of course, not\r\nonly materials wasted that might have been useful outside of the human\r\nstomach, but doctors and nurses for people who would otherwise have\r\nbeen well, and undertakers for the whole human race ten or twenty years\r\nbefore the proper time.",
        "Then again, consider the waste of time and\r\nenergy required to sell these things in a dozen stores, where one would\r\ndo.",
        "There are a million or two of business firms in the country, and\r\nfive or ten times as many clerks; and consider the handling and\r\nrehandling, the accounting and reaccounting, the planning and worrying,\r\nthe balancing of petty profit and loss.",
        "Consider the whole machinery of\r\nthe civil law made necessary by these processes; the libraries of\r\nponderous tomes, the courts and juries to interpret them, the lawyers\r\nstudying to circumvent them, the pettifogging and chicanery, the\r\nhatreds and lies!",
        "Consider the wastes incidental to the blind and\r\nhaphazard production of commodities—the factories closed, the workers\r\nidle, the goods spoiling in storage; consider the activities of the\r\nstock manipulator, the paralyzing of whole industries, the\r\noverstimulation of others, for speculative purposes; the assignments\r\nand bank failures, the crises and panics, the deserted towns and the\r\nstarving populations!",
        "Consider the energies wasted in the seeking of\r\nmarkets, the sterile trades, such as drummer, solicitor, bill-poster,\r\nadvertising agent.",
        "Consider the wastes incidental to the crowding into\r\ncities, made necessary by competition and by monopoly railroad rates;\r\nconsider the slums, the bad air, the disease and the waste of vital\r\nenergies; consider the office buildings, the waste of time and material\r\nin the piling of story upon story, and the burrowing underground!",
        "Then\r\ntake the whole business of insurance, the enormous mass of\r\nadministrative and clerical labor it involves, and all utter waste—”\r\n\r\n“I do not follow that,” said the editor.",
        "“The Cooperative Commonwealth\r\nis a universal automatic insurance company and savings bank for all its\r\nmembers.",
        "Capital being the property of all, injury to it is shared by\r\nall and made up by all.",
        "The bank is the universal government\r\ncredit-account, the ledger in which every individual’s earnings and\r\nspendings are balanced.",
        "There is also a universal government bulletin,\r\nin which are listed and precisely described everything which the\r\ncommonwealth has for sale.",
        "As no one makes any profit by the sale,\r\nthere is no longer any stimulus to extravagance, and no\r\nmisrepresentation; no cheating, no adulteration or imitation, no\r\nbribery or ‘grafting.’”\r\n\r\n“How is the price of an article determined?”\r\n\r\n“The price is the labor it has cost to make and deliver it, and it is\r\ndetermined by the first principles of arithmetic.",
        "The million workers\r\nin the nation’s wheat fields have worked a hundred days each, and the\r\ntotal product of the labor is a billion bushels, so the value of a\r\nbushel of wheat is the tenth part of a farm labor-day.",
        "If we employ an\r\narbitrary symbol, and pay, say, five dollars a day for farm work, then\r\nthe cost of a bushel of wheat is fifty cents.”\r\n\r\n“You say ‘for farm work,’” said Mr.",
        "Maynard.",
        "“Then labor is not to be\r\npaid alike?”\r\n\r\n“Manifestly not, since some work is easy and some hard, and we should\r\nhave millions of rural mail carriers, and no coal miners.",

        "In exactly the same way,\r\nas the citizens of our Industrial Republic become refined, year by year\r\nthe cost of slaughterhouse products will increase; until eventually\r\nthose who want to eat meat will have to do their own killing—and how\r\nlong do you think the custom would survive then?—To go on to another\r\nitem—one of the necessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy\r\nis political corruption; and one of the consequences of civic\r\nadministration by ignorant and vicious politicians, is that preventable\r\ndiseases kill off half our population.",

        "For\r\nthis reason I would seriously maintain that all the medical and\r\nsurgical discoveries that science can make in the future will be of\r\nless importance than the application of the knowledge we already\r\npossess, when the disinherited of the earth have established their\r\nright to a human existence.”\r\n\r\nAnd here the Herr Doctor relapsed into silence again.",

        "But already there were people waiting, and already the telegraph\r\ninstrument on the stage had begun clicking off the returns.",
        "When the\r\nfinal accounts were made up, the Socialist vote proved to be over four\r\nhundred thousand—an increase of something like three hundred and fifty\r\nper cent in four years.",
        "And that was doing well; but the party was\r\ndependent for its early returns upon messages from the locals, and\r\nnaturally those locals which had been most successful were the ones\r\nwhich felt most like reporting; and so that night every one in the hall\r\nbelieved that the vote was going to be six, or seven, or even eight\r\nhundred thousand.",
        "Just such an incredible increase had actually been\r\nmade in Chicago, and in the state; the vote of the city had been 6,700\r\nin 1900, and now it was 47,000; that of Illinois had been 9,600, and\r\nnow it was 69,000!",
        "So, as the evening waxed, and the crowd piled in,\r\nthe meeting was a sight to be seen.",
        "Bulletins would be read, and the\r\npeople would shout themselves hoarse—and then some one would make a\r\nspeech, and there would be more shouting; and then a brief silence, and\r\nmore bulletins.",
        "There would come messages from the secretaries of\r\nneighboring states, reporting their achievements; the vote of Indiana\r\nhad gone from 2,300 to 12,000, of Wisconsin from 7,000 to 28,000; of\r\nOhio from 4,800 to 36,000!",
        "There were telegrams to the national office\r\nfrom enthusiastic individuals in little towns which had made amazing\r\nand unprecedented increases in a single year: Benedict, Kansas, from 26\r\nto 260; Henderson, Kentucky, from 19 to 111; Holland, Michigan, from 14\r\nto 208; Cleo, Oklahoma, from 0 to 104; Martin’s Ferry, Ohio, from 0 to\r\n296—and many more of the same kind.",

        "And the men who read the despatches off to\r\nthe audience were old campaigners, who had been to the places and\r\nhelped to make the vote, and could make appropriate comments: Quincy,\r\nIllinois, from 189 to 831—that was where the mayor had arrested a\r\nSocialist speaker!",
        "Crawford County, Kansas, from 285 to 1,975; that was\r\nthe home of the “Appeal to Reason”!",
        "Battle Creek, Michigan, from 4,261\r\nto 10,184; that was the answer of labor to the Citizens’ Alliance\r\nMovement!",
        "And then there were official returns from the various precincts and\r\nwards of the city itself!",
        "Whether it was a factory district or one of\r\nthe “silk-stocking” wards seemed to make no particular difference in\r\nthe increase; but one of the things which surprised the party leaders\r\nmost was the tremendous vote that came rolling in from the stockyards.",
        "Packingtown comprised three wards of the city, and the vote in the\r\nspring of 1903 had been 500, and in the fall of the same year, 1,600.",
        "Now, only one year later, it was over 6,300—and the Democratic vote\r\nonly 8,800!",
        "There were other wards in which the Democratic vote had\r\nbeen actually surpassed, and in two districts, members of the state\r\nlegislature had been elected.",
        "Thus Chicago now led the country; it had\r\nset a new standard for the party, it had shown the workingmen the way!",
        "—So spoke an orator upon the platform; and two thousand pairs of eyes\r\nwere fixed upon him, and two thousand voices were cheering his every\r\nsentence.",
        "The orator had been the head of the city’s relief bureau in\r\nthe stockyards, until the sight of misery and corruption had made him\r\nsick.",
        "He was young, hungry-looking, full of fire; and as he swung his\r\nlong arms and beat up the crowd, to Jurgis he seemed the very spirit of\r\nthe revolution.",
        "“Organize!",
        "Organize!",
        "Organize!”—that was his cry.",

        "It rests with you to\r\ntake your resolution—now, in the flush of victory, to find these men\r\nwho have voted for us, and bring them to our meetings, and organize\r\nthem and bind them to us!",
        "We shall not find all our campaigns as easy\r\nas this one.",
        "Everywhere in the country tonight the old party\r\npoliticians are studying this vote, and setting their sails by it; and\r\nnowhere will they be quicker or more cunning than here in our own city.",
        "Fifty thousand Socialist votes in Chicago means a municipal-ownership\r\nDemocracy in the spring!",

        "But whatever they may do when they get in, there is one thing\r\nthey will not do, and that will be the thing for which they were\r\nelected!",
        "They will not give the people of our city municipal\r\nownership—they will not mean to do it, they will not try to do it; all\r\nthat they will do is give our party in Chicago the greatest opportunity\r\nthat has ever come to Socialism in America!",
        "We shall have the sham\r\nreformers self-stultified and self-convicted; we shall have the radical\r\nDemocracy left without a lie with which to cover its nakedness!",

        "Jessup was a littlish man, skinny, smiling, well tanned, with a small gray mustache, a small and well-trimmed gray beard—in a community where to sport a beard was to confess one's self a farmer, a Civil War veteran, or a Seventh Day Adventist.",
        "Doremus's detractors said that he maintained the beard just to be \"highbrow\" and \"different,\" to try to appear \"artistic.\" Possibly they were right.",

        "My friend, Mrs.",
        "Pike, ought to know that freedom of speech becomes mere license when it goes so far as to criticize the Army, differ with the D.A.R., and advocate the rights of the Mob.",

        "I do apologize, General!",
        "Thank you for your revelatory speech!\"\r\n\r\nThe General raised his plump hand (with a Masonic ring as well as a West Point ring on the sausage-shaped fingers); he bowed like Galahad or a head-waiter; he shouted with parade-ground maleness: \"Not at all, not at all, madame!",
        "We old campaigners never mind a healthy scrap.",
        "Glad when anybody's enough interested in our fool ideas to go and get sore at us, huh, huh, huh!\"\r\n\r\nAnd everybody laughed and sweetness reigned.",

        "But Louis was a jingo.",
        "He explained, and rather often, that it was not he nor his father who had been born in the ghetto in Prussian Poland, but his grandfather (whose name, Doremus suspected, had been something less stylish and Nordic than Rotenstern).",
        "Louis's pocket heroes were Calvin Coolidge, Leonard Wood, Dwight L.",
        "Moody, and Admiral Dewey (and Dewey was a born Vermonter, rejoiced Louis, who himself had been born in Flatbush, Long Island).",
        "He was not only 100 per cent American; he exacted 40 per cent of chauvinistic interest on top of the principal.",
        "He was on every occasion heard to say, \"We ought to keep all these foreigners out of the country, and what I mean, the Kikes just as much as the Wops and Hunkies and Chinks.\" Louis was altogether convinced that if the ignorant politicians would keep their dirty hands off banking and the stock exchange and hours of labor for salesmen in department stores, then everyone in the country would profit, as beneficiaries of increased business, and all of them (including the retail clerks) be rich as Aga Khan.",
        "So Louis put into his melodies not only his burning voice of a Bydgoszcz cantor but all his nationalistic fervor, so that every one joined in the choruses, particularly Mrs.",
        "Adelaide Tarr Gimmitch, with her celebrated train-caller's contralto.",
        "The dinner broke up in cataract-like sounds of happy adieux, and Doremus Jessup muttered to his goodwife Emma, a solid, kindly, worried soul, who liked knitting, solitaire, and the novels of Kathleen Norris: \"Was I terrible, butting in that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Dormouse, you did just right.",
        "I am fond of Lorinda Pike, but why does she have to show off and parade all her silly Socialist ideas?\"\r\n\r\n\"You old Tory!\" said Doremus.",

        "Legally a city, Fort Beulah was a comfortable village of old red brick, old granite workshops, and houses of white clapboards or gray shingles, with a few smug little modern bungalows, yellow or seal brown.",

        "Olmsted, of Lawyer Mungo Kitterick, of Harry Kindermann, agent for maple syrup and dairying supplies, and of thirty or forty other village samurai.",
        "It was a downy town, a drowsy town, a town of security and tradition, which still believed in Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, Memorial Day, and to which May Day was not an occasion for labor parades but for distributing small baskets of flowers.",
        "It was a May night—late in May of 1936—with a three-quarter moon.",
        "Doremus's house was a mile from the business-center of Fort Beulah, on Pleasant Hill, which was a spur thrust like a reaching hand out from the dark rearing mass of Mount Terror.",

        "His mother was no less than a Bass, of Massachusetts.",
        "The Reverend Loren, a bookish man and fond of flowers, merry but not noticeably witty, used to chant \"Alas, alas, that a Bass of Mass should marry a minister prone to gas,\" and he would insist that she was all wrong ichthyologically—she should have been a cod, not a bass.",
        "There was in the parsonage little meat but plenty of books, not all theological by any means, so that before he was twelve Doremus knew the profane writings of Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, Jane Austen, Tennyson, Byron, Keats, Shelley, Tolstoy, Balzac.",
        "He graduated from Isaiah College—once a bold Unitarian venture but by 1894 an inter-denominational outfit with nebulous trinitarian yearnings, a small and rustic stable of learning, in North Beulah, thirteen miles from \"the Fort.\"\r\n\r\nBut Isaiah College has come up in the world today—excepting educationally—for in 1931 it held the Dartmouth football team down to 64 to 6.",
        "During college, Doremus wrote a great deal of bad poetry and became an incurable book addict, but he was a fair track athlete.",
        "Naturally, he corresponded for papers in Boston and Springfield, and after graduation he was a reporter in Rutland and Worcester, with one glorious year in Boston, whose grimy beauty and shards of the past were to him what London would be to a young Yorkshireman.",
        "He was excited by concerts, art galleries, and bookshops; thrice a week he had a twenty-five-cent seat in the upper balcony of some theater; and for two months he roomed with a fellow reporter who had actually had a short story in The Century and who could talk about authors and technique like the very dickens.",
        "But Doremus was not particularly beefy or enduring, and the noise, the traffic, the bustle of assignments, exhausted him, and in 1901, three years after his graduation from college, when his widowed father died and left him $2980.00 and his library, Doremus went home to Fort Beulah and bought a quarter interest in the Informer, then a weekly.",
        "By 1936 it was a daily, and he owned all of it...",
        "with a perceptible mortgage.",
        "He was an equable and sympathetic boss; an imaginative news detective; he was, even in this ironbound Republican state, independent in politics; and in his editorials against graft and injustice, though they were not fanatically chronic, he could slash like a dog whip.",
        "He was a third cousin of Calvin Coolidge, who had considered him sound domestically but loose politically.",
        "Doremus considered himself just the opposite.",
        "He had married his wife, Emma, out of Fort Beulah.",
        "She was the daughter of a wagon manufacturer, a placid, prettyish, broad-shouldered girl with whom he had gone to high school.",
        "Now, in 1936, of their three children, Philip (Dartmouth, and Harvard Law School) was married and ambitiously practicing law in Worcester; Mary was the wife of Fowler Greenhill, M.D., of Fort Beulah, a gay and hustling medico, a choleric and red-headed young man, who was a wonder-worker in typhoid, acute appendicitis, obstetrics, compound fractures, and diets for anemic children.",
        "Fowler and Mary had one son, Doremus's only grandchild, the bonny David, who at eight was a timid, inventive, affectionate child with such mourning hound-dog eyes and such red-gold hair that his picture might well have been hung at a National Academy show or even been reproduced on the cover of a Women's Magazine with 2,500,000 circulation.",
        "The Greenhills' neighbors inevitably said of the boy, \"My, Davy's got such an imagination, hasn't he!",
        "I guess he'll be a Writer, just like his Grampa!\"\r\n\r\nThird of Doremus's children was the gay, the pert, the dancing Cecilia, known as \"Sissy,\" aged eighteen, where her brother Philip was thirty-two and Mary, Mrs.",
        "Greenhill, turned thirty.",
        "She rejoiced the heart of Doremus by consenting to stay home while she was finishing high school, though she talked vigorously of going off to study architecture and \"simply make millions, my dear,\" by planning and erecting miraculous small homes.",
        "Mrs.",
        "Jessup was lavishly (and quite erroneously) certain that her Philip was the spit and image of the Prince of Wales; Philip's wife, Merilla (the fair daughter of Worcester, Massachusetts), curiously like the Princess Marina; that Mary would by any stranger be taken for Katharine Hepburn; that Sissy was a dryad and David a medieval page; and that Doremus (though she knew him better than she did those changelings, her children) amazingly resembled that naval hero, Winfield Scott Schley, as he looked in 1898.",
        "She was a loyal woman, Emma Jessup, warmly generous, a cordon bleu at making lemon-meringue pie, a parochial Tory, an orthodox Episcopalian, and completely innocent of any humor.",
        "Doremus was perpetually tickled by her kind solemnity, and it was to be chalked down to him as a singular act of grace that he refrained from pretending that he had become a working Communist and was thinking of leaving for Moscow immediately.",
        "Doremus looked depressed, looked old, when he lifted himself, as from an invalid's chair, out of the Chrysler, in his hideous garage of cement and galvanized iron.",
        "(But it was a proud two-car garage; besides the four-year-old Chrysler, they had a new Ford convertible coupe, which Doremus hoped to drive some day when Sissy wasn't using it.)\r\n\r\nHe cursed competently as, on the cement walk from the garage to the kitchen, he barked his shins on the lawn-mower, left there by his hired man, one Oscar Ledue, known always as \"Shad,\" a large and red-faced, a sulky and surly Irish-Canuck peasant.",
        "Shad always did things like leaving lawnmowers about to snap at the shins of decent people.",
        "He was entirely incompetent and vicious.",
        "He never edged-up the flower beds, he kept his stinking old cap on his head when he brought in logs for the fireplace, he did not scythe the dandelions in the meadow till they had gone to seed, he delighted in failing to tell cook that the peas were now ripe, and he was given to shooting cats, stray dogs, chipmunks, and honey-voiced blackbirds.",
        "At least twice a day, Doremus resolved to fire him, but—Perhaps he was telling himself the truth when he insisted that it was amusing to try to civilize this prize bull.",
        "Doremus trotted into the kitchen, decided that he did not want some cold chicken and a glass of milk from the ice-box, nor even a wedge of the celebrated cocoanut layer cake made by their cook-general, Mrs.",
        "Candy, and mounted to his \"study,\" on the third, the attic floor.",
        "His house was an ample, white, clapboarded structure of the vintage of 1880, a square bulk with a mansard roof and, in front, a long porch with insignificant square white pillars.",
        "Doremus declared that the house was ugly, \"but ugly in a nice way.\"\r\n\r\nHis study, up there, was his one perfect refuge from annoyances and bustle.",
        "It was the only room in the house that Mrs.",
        "Candy (quiet, grimly competent, thoroughly literate, once a Vermont country schoolteacher) was never allowed to clean.",
        "It was an endearing mess of novels, copies of the Congressional Record, of the New Yorker, Time, Nation, New Republic, New Masses, and Speculum (cloistral organ of the Medieval Society), treatises on taxation and monetary systems, road maps, volumes on exploration in Abyssinia and the Antarctic, chewed stubs of pencils, a shaky portable typewriter, fishing tackle, rumpled carbon paper, two comfortable old leather chairs, a Windsor chair at his desk, the complete works of Thomas Jefferson, his chief hero, a microscope and a collection of Vermont butterflies, Indian arrowheads, exiguous volumes of Vermont village poetry printed in local newspaper offices, the Bible, the Koran, the Book of Mormon, Science and Health, Selections from the Mahabharata, the poetry of Sandburg, Frost, Masters, Jeffers, Ogden Nash, Edgar Guest, Omar Khayyam, and Milton, a shotgun and a .22 repeating rifle, an Isaiah College banner, faded, the complete Oxford Dictionary, five fountain pens of which two would work, a vase from Crete dating from 327 B.C.—very ugly—the World Almanac for year before last, with the cover suggesting that it had been chewed by a dog, odd pairs of horn-rimmed spectacles and of rimless eyeglasses, none of which now suited his eyes, a fine, reputedly Tudor oak cabinet from Devonshire, portraits of Ethan Allen and Thaddeus Stevens, rubber wading-boots, senile red morocco slippers, a poster issued by the Vermont Mercury at Woodstock, on September 2, 1840, announcing a glorious Whig victory, twenty-four boxes of safety matches one by one stolen from the kitchen, assorted yellow scratch pads, seven books on Russia and Bolshevism—extraordinarily pro or extraordinarily con—a signed photograph of Theodore Roosevelt, six cigarette cartons, all half empty (according to the tradition of journalistic eccentrics, Doremus should have smoked a Good Old Pipe, but he detested the slimy ooze of nicotine-soaked spittle), a rag carpet on the floor, a withered sprig of holly with a silver Christmas ribbon, a case of seven unused genuine Sheffield razors, dictionaries in French, German, Italian and Spanish—the first of which languages he really could read—a canary in a Bavarian gilded wicker cage, a worn linen-bound copy of Old Hearthside Songs for Home and Picnic whose selections he was wont to croon, holding the book on his knee, and an old cast-iron Franklin stove.",

        "It was a kind country, cool and clear as a shaft of light and, he meditated, he loved it more every quiet year of his freedom from city towers and city clamor.",
        "One of the few times when Mrs.",
        "Candy, their housekeeper, was permitted to enter his hermit's cell was to leave there, on the long table, his mail.",

        "(Time to go to bed!",
        "Too much chatter and bellyaching, this evening!",
        "Good Lord!",

        "On the door was a tearing sound, imperious, demanding.",
        "He opened to admit Foolish, the family dog.",
        "Foolish was a reliable combination of English setter, Airedale, cocker spaniel, wistful doe, and rearing hyena.",
        "He gave one abrupt snort of welcome and nuzzled his brown satin head against Doremus's knee.",
        "His bark awakened the canary, under the absurd old blue sweater that covered its cage, and it automatically caroled that it was noon, summer noon, among the pear trees in the green Harz hills, none of which was true.",
        "But the bird's trilling, the dependable presence of Foolish, comforted Doremus, made military drill and belching politicians seem unimportant, and in security he dropped asleep in the worn brown leather chair.",
        "CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nALL this June week, Doremus was waiting for 2 P.M.",
        "on Saturday, the divinely appointed hour of the weekly prophetic broadcast by Bishop Paul Peter Prang.",
        "Now, six weeks before the 1936 national conventions, it was probable that neither Franklin Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, Senator Vandenberg, Ogden Mills, General Hugh Johnson, Colonel Frank Knox, nor Senator Borah would be nominated for President by either party, and that the Republican standard-bearer—meaning the one man who never has to lug a large, bothersome, and somewhat ridiculous standard—would be that loyal yet strangely honest old-line Senator, Walt Trowbridge, a man with a touch of Lincoln in him, dashes of Will Rogers and George W.",
        "Norris, a suspected trace of Jim Farley, but all the rest plain, bulky, placidly defiant Walt Trowbridge.",
        "Few men doubted that the Democratic candidate would be that sky-rocket, Senator Berzelius Windrip—that is to say, Windrip as the mask and bellowing voice, with his satanic secretary, Lee Sarason, as the brain behind.",
        "Senator Windrip's father was a small-town Western druggist, equally ambitious and unsuccessful, and had named him Berzelius after the Swedish chemist.",
        "Usually he was known as \"Buzz.\" He had worked his way through a Southern Baptist college, of approximately the same academic standing as a Jersey City business college, and through a Chicago law school, and settled down to practice in his native state and to enliven local politics.",
        "He was a tireless traveler, a boisterous and humorous speaker, an inspired guesser at what political doctrines the people would like, a warm handshaker, and willing to lend money.",
        "He drank Coca-Cola with the Methodists, beer with the Lutherans, California white wine with the Jewish village merchants—and, when they were safe from observation, white-mule corn whisky with all of them.",
        "Within twenty years he was as absolute a ruler of his state as ever a sultan was of Turkey.",
        "He was never governor; he had shrewdly seen that his reputation for research among planters-punch recipes, varieties of poker, and the psychology of girl stenographers might cause his defeat by the church people, so he had contented himself with coaxing to the gubernatorial shearing a trained baa-lamb of a country schoolmaster whom he had gayly led on a wide blue ribbon.",
        "The state was certain that he had \"given it a good administration,\" and they knew that it was Buzz Windrip who was responsible, not the Governor.",
        "Windrip caused the building of impressive highroads and of consolidated country schools; he made the state buy tractors and combines and lend them to the farmers at cost.",
        "He was certain that some day America would have vast business dealings with the Russians and, though he detested all Slavs, he made the State University put in the first course in the Russian language that had been known in all that part of the West.",
        "His most original invention was quadrupling the state militia and rewarding the best soldiers in it with training in agriculture, aviation, and radio and automobile engineering.",
        "The militiamen considered him their general and their god, and when the state attorney general announced that he was going to have Windrip indicted for having grafted $200,000 of tax money, the militia rose to Buzz Windrip's orders as though they were his private army and, occupying the legislative chambers and all the state offices, and covering the streets leading to the Capitol with machine guns, they herded Buzz's enemies out of town.",
        "He took the United States Senatorship as though it were his manorial right, and for six years, his only rival as the most bouncing and feverish man in the Senate had been the late Huey Long of Louisiana.",
        "He preached the comforting gospel of so redistributing wealth that every person in the country would have several thousand dollars a year (monthly Buzz changed his prediction as to how many thousand), while all the rich men were nevertheless to be allowed enough to get along, on a maximum of $500,000 a year.",
        "So everybody was happy in the prospect of Windrip's becoming president.",
        "The Reverend Dr.",
        "Egerton Schlemil, dean of St.",
        "Agnes Cathedral, San Antonio, Texas, stated (once in a sermon, once in the slightly variant mimeographed press handout on the sermon, and seven times in interviews) that Buzz's coming into power would be \"like the Heaven-blest fall of revivifying rain upon a parched and thirsty land.\" Dr.",
        "Schlemil did not say anything about what happened when the blest rain came and kept falling steadily for four years.",
        "No one, even among the Washington correspondents, seemed to know precisely how much of a part in Senator Windrip's career was taken by his secretary, Lee Sarason.",
        "When Windrip had first seized power in his state, Sarason had been managing editor of the most widely circulated paper in all that part of the country.",
        "Sarason's genesis was and remained a mystery.",
        "It was said that he had been born in Georgia, in Minnesota, on the East Side of New York, in Syria; that he was pure Yankee, Jewish, Charleston Huguenot.",
        "It was known that he had been a singularly reckless lieutenant of machine-gunners as a youngster during the Great War, and that he had stayed over, ambling about Europe, for three or four years; that he had worked on the Paris edition of the New York Herald; nibbled at painting and at Black Magic in Florence and Munich; had a few sociological months at the London School of Economics; associated with decidedly curious people in arty Berlin night restaurants.",
        "Returned home, Sarason had become decidedly the \"hard-boiled reporter\" of the shirt-sleeved tradition, who asserted that he would rather be called a prostitute than anything so sissified as \"journalist.\" But it was suspected that nevertheless he still retained the ability to read.",
        "He had been variously a Socialist and an anarchist.",
        "Even in 1936 there were rich people who asserted that Sarason was \"too radical,\" but actually he had lost his trust (if any) in the masses during the hoggish nationalism after the war; and he believed now only in resolute control by a small oligarchy.",
        "In this he was a Hitler, a Mussolini.",
        "Sarason was lanky and drooping, with thin flaxen hair, and thick lips in a bony face.",
        "His eyes were sparks at the bottoms of two dark wells.",
        "In his long hands there was bloodless strength.",
        "He used to surprise persons who were about to shake hands with him by suddenly bending their fingers back till they almost broke.",
        "Most people didn't much like it.",
        "As a newspaperman he was an expert of the highest grade.",
        "He could smell out a husband-murder, the grafting of a politician—that is to say, of a politician belonging to a gang opposed by his paper—the torture of animals or children, and this last sort of story he liked to write himself, rather than hand it to a reporter, and when he did write it, you saw the moldy cellar, heard the whip, felt the slimy blood.",
        "Compared with Lee Sarason as a newspaperman, little Doremus Jessup of Fort Beulah was like a village parson compared with the twenty-thousand-dollar minister of a twenty-story New York institutional tabernacle with radio affiliations.",
        "Senator Windrip had made Sarason, officially, his secretary, but he was known to be much more—bodyguard, ghost-writer, press-agent, economic adviser; and in Washington, Lee Sarason became the man most consulted and least liked by newspaper correspondents in the whole Senate Office Building.",
        "Windrip was a young forty-eight in 1936; Sarason an aged and sagging-cheeked forty-one.",
        "Though he probably based it on notes dictated by Windrip—himself no fool in the matter of fictional imagination—Sarason had certainly done the actual writing of Windrip's lone book, the Bible of his followers, part biography, part economic program, and part plain exhibitionistic boasting, called Zero Hour—Over the Top.",
        "It was a salty book and contained more suggestions for remolding the world than the three volumes of Karl Marx and all the novels of H.",
        "G.",
        "Wells put together.",
        "Perhaps the most familiar, most quoted paragraph of Zero Hour, beloved by the provincial press because of its simple earthiness (as written by an initiate in Rosicrucian lore, named Sarason) was:\r\n\r\n\"When I was a little shaver back in the corn fields, we kids used to just wear one-strap suspenders on our pants, and we called them the Galluses on our Britches, but they held them up and saved our modesty just as much as if we had put on a high-toned Limey accent and talked about Braces and Trousers.",
        "That's how the whole world of what they call 'scientific economics' is like.",
        "The Marxians think that by writing of Galluses as Braces, they've got something that knocks the stuffings out of the old-fashioned ideas of Washington and Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.",
        "Well and all, I sure believe in using every new economic discovery, like they have been worked out in the so-called Fascist countries, like Italy and Germany and Hungary and Poland—yes, by thunder, and even in Japan— we probably will have to lick those Little Yellow Men some day, to keep them from pinching our vested and rightful interests in China, but don't let that keep us from grabbing off any smart ideas that those cute little beggars have worked out!",
        "\"I want to stand up on my hind legs and not just admit but frankly holler right out that we've got to change our system a lot, maybe even change the whole Constitution (but change it legally, and not by violence) to bring it up from the horseback-and-corduroy-road epoch to the automobile-and-cement-highway period of today.",
        "The Executive has got to have a freer hand and be able to move quick in an emergency, and not be tied down by a lot of dumb shyster-lawyer congressmen taking months to shoot off their mouths in debates.",
        "BUT—and it's a But as big as Deacon Checkerboard's hay-barn back home—these new economic changes are only a means to an End, and that End is and must be, fundamentally, the same principles of Liberty, Equality, and Justice that were advocated by the Founding Fathers of this great land back in 1776!\"\r\n\r\nThe most confusing thing about the whole campaign of 1936 was the relationship of the two leading parties.",
        "Old-Guard Republicans complained that their proud party was begging for office, hat in hand; veteran Democrats that their traditional Covered Wagons were jammed with college professors, city slickers, and yachtsmen.",
        "The rival to Senator Windrip in public reverence was a political titan who seemed to have no itch for office—the Reverend Paul Peter Prang, of Persepolis, Indiana, Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, a man perhaps ten years older than Windrip.",
        "His weekly radio address, at 2 P.M.",
        "every Saturday, was to millions the very oracle of God.",
        "So supernatural was this voice from the air that for it men delayed their golf, and women even postponed their Saturday afternoon contract bridge.",
        "It was Father Charles Coughlin, of Detroit, who had first thought out the device of freeing himself from any censorship of his political sermons on the Mount by \"buying his own time on the air\"— it being only in the twentieth century that mankind has been able to buy Time as it buys soap and gasoline.",
        "This invention was almost equal, in its effect on all American life and thought, to Henry Ford's early conception of selling cars cheap to millions of people, instead of selling a few as luxuries.",
        "But to the pioneer Father Coughlin, Bishop Paul Peter Prang was as the Ford V-8 to the Model A.",
        "Prang was more sentimental than Coughlin; he shouted more; he agonized more; he reviled more enemies by name, and rather scandalously; he told more funny stories, and ever so many more tragic stories about the repentant deathbeds of bankers, atheists, and Communists.",
        "His voice was more nasally native, and he was pure Middle West, with a New England Protestant Scotch-English ancestry, where Coughlin was always a little suspect, in the Sears-Roebuck regions, as a Roman Catholic with an agreeable Irish accent.",
        "No man in history has ever had such an audience as Bishop Prang, nor so much apparent power.",
        "When he demanded that his auditors telegraph their congressmen to vote on a bill as he, Prang, ex cathedra and alone, without any college of cardinals, had been inspired to believe they ought to vote, then fifty thousand people would telephone, or drive through back-hill mud, to the nearest telegraph office and in His name give their commands to the government.",
        "Thus, by the magic of electricity, Prang made the position of any king in history look a little absurd and tinseled.",
        "To millions of League members he sent mimeographed letters with facsimile signature, and with the salutation so craftily typed in that they rejoiced in a personal greeting from the Founder.",
        "Doremus Jessup, up in the provincial hills, could never quite figure out just what political gospel it was that Bishop Prang thundered from his Sinai which, with its microphone and typed revelations timed to the split-second, was so much more snappy and efficient than the original Sinai.",
        "In detail, he preached nationalization of the banks, mines, waterpower, and transportation; limitation of incomes; increased wages, strengthening of the labor unions, more fluid distribution of consumer goods.",
        "But everybody was nibbling at those noble doctrines now, from Virginia Senators to Minnesota Farmer-Laborites, with no one being so credulous as to expect any of them to be carried out.",
        "There was a theory around some place that Prang was only the humble voice of his vast organization, \"The League of Forgotten Men.\" It was universally believed to have (though no firm of chartered accountants had yet examined its rolls) twenty-seven million members, along with proper assortments of national officers and state officers, and town officers and hordes of committees with stately names like \"National Committee on the Compilation of Statistics on Unemployment and Normal Employability in the Soy-Bean Industry.\" Hither and yon, Bishop Prang, not as the still small voice of God but in lofty person, addressed audiences of twenty thousand persons at a time, in the larger cities all over the country, speaking in huge halls meant for prize-fighting, in cinema palaces, in armories, in baseball parks, in circus tents, while after the meetings his brisk assistants accepted membership applications and dues for the League of Forgotten Men.",
        "When his timid detractors hinted that this was all very romantic, very jolly and picturesque, but not particularly dignified, and Bishop Prang answered, \"My Master delighted to speak in whatever vulgar assembly would listen to Him,\" no one dared answer him, \"But you aren't your Master—not yet.\"\r\n\r\nWith all the flourish of the League and its mass meetings, there had never been a pretense that any tenet of the League, any pressure on Congress and the President to pass any particular bill, originated with anybody save Prang himself, with no collaboration from the committees or officers of the League.",
        "All that the Prang who so often crooned about the Humility and Modesty of the Saviour wanted was for one hundred and thirty million people to obey him, their Priest-King, implicitly in everything concerning their private morals, their public asseverations, how they might earn their livings, and what relationships they might have to other wage-earners.",
        "\"And that,\" Doremus Jessup grumbled, relishing the shocked piety of his wife Emma, \"makes Brother Prang a worse tyrant than Caligula—a worse Fascist than Napoleon.",
        "Mind you, I don't really believe all these rumors about Prang's grafting on membership dues and the sale of pamphlets and donations to pay for the radio.",
        "It's much worse than that.",
        "I'm afraid he's an honest fanatic!",
        "That's why he's such a real Fascist menace—he's so confoundedly humanitarian, in fact so Noble, that a majority of people are willing to let him boss everything, and with a country this size, that's quite a job— quite a job, my beloved—even for a Methodist Bishop who gets enough gifts so that he can actually 'buy Time'!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the while, Walt Trowbridge, possible Republican candidate for President, suffering from the deficiency of being honest and disinclined to promise that he could work miracles, was insisting that we live in the United States of America and not on a golden highway to Utopia.",
        "There was nothing exhilarating in such realism, so all this rainy week in June, with the apple blossoms and the lilacs fading, Doremus Jessup was awaiting the next encyclical of Pope Paul Peter Prang.",
        "CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nI KNOW the Press only too well.",
        "Almost all editors hide away in spider-dens, men without thought of Family or Public Interest or the humble delights of jaunts out-of-doors, plotting how they can put over their lies, and advance their own positions and fill their greedy pocketbooks by calumniating Statesmen who have given their all for the common good and who are vulnerable because they stand out in the fierce Light that beats around the Throne.",
        "Zero Hour, Berzelius Windrip.",
        "THE June morning shone, the last petals of the wild-cherry blossoms lay dew-covered on the grass, robins were about their brisk business on the lawn.",
        "Doremus, by nature a late-lier and pilferer of naps after he had been called at eight, was stirred to spring up and stretch his arms out fully five or six times in Swedish exercises, in front of his window, looking out across the Beulah River Valley to dark masses of pine on the mountain slopes three miles away.",
        "Doremus and Emma had had each their own bedroom, these fifteen years, not altogether to her pleasure.",
        "He asserted that he couldn't share a bedroom with any person living, because he was a night-mutterer, and liked to make a really good, uprearing, pillow-slapping job of turning over in bed without feeling that he was disturbing someone.",
        "It was Saturday, the day of the Prang revelation, but on this crystal morning, after days of rain, he did not think of Prang at all, but of the fact that Philip, his son, with wife, had popped up from Worcester for the week-end, and that the whole crew of them, along with Lorinda Pike and Buck Titus, were going to have a \"real, old-fashioned, family picnic.\"\r\n\r\nThey had all demanded it, even the fashionable Sissy, a woman who, at eighteen, had much concern with tennis-teas, golf, and mysterious, appallingly rapid motor trips with Malcolm Tasbrough (just graduating from high school), or with the Episcopal parson's grandson, Julian Falck (freshman in Amherst).",
        "Doremus had scolded that he couldn't go to any blame picnic; it was his job, as editor, to stay home and listen to Bishop Prang's broadcast at two; but they had laughed at him and rumpled his hair and miscalled him until he had promised....",
        "They didn't know it, but he had slyly borrowed a portable radio from his friend, the local R.",
        "C.",
        "priest, Father Stephen Perefixe, and he was going to hear Prang whether or no.",
        "He was glad they were going to have Lorinda Pike—he was fond of that sardonic saint—and Buck Titus, who was perhaps his closest intimate.",
        "James Buck Titus, who was fifty but looked thirty-eight, straight, broad-shouldered, slim-waisted, long-mustached, swarthy—Buck was the Dan'l Boone type of Old American, or, perhaps, an Indian-fighting cavalry captain, out of Charles King.",
        "He had graduated from Williams, with ten weeks in England and ten years in Montana, divided between cattle-raising, prospecting, and a horse-breeding ranch.",
        "His father, a richish railroad contractor, had left him the great farm near West Beulah, and Buck had come back home to grow apples, to breed Morgan stallions, and to read Voltaire, Anatole France, Nietzsche, and Dostoyefsky.",
        "He served in the war, as a private; detested his officers, refused a commission, and liked the Germans at Cologne.",
        "He was a useful polo player, but regarded riding to the hounds as childish.",
        "In politics, he did not so much yearn over the wrongs of Labor as feel scornful of the tight-fisted exploiters who denned in office and stinking factory.",
        "He was as near to the English country squire as one may find in America.",
        "He was a bachelor, with a big mid-Victorian house, well kept by a friendly Negro couple; a tidy place in which he sometimes entertained ladies who were not quite so tidy.",
        "He called himself an \"agnostic\" instead of an \"atheist\" only because he detested the street-bawling, tract-peddling evangelicism of the professional atheists.",
        "He was cynical, he rarely smiled, and he was unwaveringly loyal to all the Jessups.",
        "His coming to the picnic made Doremus as blithe as his grandson David.",
        "\"Perhaps, even under Fascism, the 'Church clock will stand at ten to three, and there will be honey still for tea,'\" Doremus hoped, as he put on his rather dandified country tweeds.",
        "The only stain on the preparations for the picnic was the grouchiness of the hired man, Shad Ledue.",
        "When he was asked to turn the ice-cream freezer he growled, \"Why the heck don't you folks get an electric freezer?",
        "He grumbled, most audibly, at the weight of the picnic baskets, and when he was asked to clean up the basement during their absence, he retorted only with a glare of silent fury.",
        "\"You ought to get rid of that fellow, Ledue,\" urged Doremus's son Philip, the lawyer.",
        "\"Oh, I don't know,\" considered Doremus.",
        "\"Probably just shiftlessness on my part.",
        "But I tell myself I'm doing a social experiment—trying to train him to be as gracious as the average Neanderthal man.",
        "Or perhaps I'm scared of him—he's the kind of vindictive peasant that sets fire to barns...",
        ".",
        "Did you know that he actually reads, Phil?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep.",
        "Mostly movie magazines, with nekked ladies and Wild Western stories, but he also reads the papers.",
        "Told me he greatly admired Buzz Windrip; says Windrip will certainly be President, and then everybody—by which, I'm afraid, Shad means only himself—will have five thousand a year.",
        "Buzz certainly has a bunch of philanthropists for followers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now listen, Dad.",
        "You don't understand Senator Windrip.",
        "Oh, he's something of a demagogue—he shoots off his mouth a lot about how he'll jack up the income tax and grab the banks, but he won't— that's just molasses for the cockroaches.",
        "What he will do, and maybe only he can do it, is to protect us from the murdering, thieving, lying Bolsheviks that would—why, they'd like to stick all of us that are going on this picnic, all the decent clean people that are accustomed to privacy, into hall bedrooms, and make us cook our cabbage soup on a Primus stuck on a bed!",
        "Yes, or maybe 'liquidate' us entirely!",
        "No sir, Berzelius Windrip is the fellow to balk the dirty sneaking Jew spies that pose as American Liberals!\"\r\n\r\n\"The face is the face of my reasonably competent son, Philip, but the voice is the voice of the Jew-baiter, Julius Streicher,\" sighed Doremus.",
        "The picnic ground was among a Stonehenge of gray and lichen-painted rocks, fronting a birch grove high up on Mount Terror, on the upland farm of Doremus's cousin, Henry Veeder, a solid, reticent Vermonter of the old days.",
        "They looked through a distant mountain gap to the faint mercury of Lake Champlain and, across it, the bulwark of the Adirondacks.",
        "Davy Greenhill and his hero, Buck Titus, wrestled in the hardy pasture grass.",
        "Philip and Dr.",
        "Fowler Greenhill, Doremus's son-in-law (Phil plump and half bald at thirty-two; Fowler belligerently red-headed and red-mustached) argued about the merits of the autogiro.",
        "Doremus lay with his head against a rock, his cap over his eyes, gazing down into the paradise of Beulah Valley—he could not have sworn to it, but he rather thought he saw an angel floating in the radiant upper air above the valley.",
        "The women, Emma and Mary Greenhill, Sissy and Philip's wife and Lorinda Pike, were setting out the picnic lunch—a pot of beans with crisp salt pork, fried chicken, potatoes warmed-over with croutons, tea biscuits, crab-apple jelly, salad, raisin pie—on a red-and-white tablecloth spread on a flat rock.",
        "But for the parked motorcars, the scene might have been New England in 1885, and you could see the women in chip hats and tight-bodiced, high-necked frocks with bustles; the men in straw boaters with dangling ribbons and adorned with side-whiskers—Doremus's beard not clipped, but flowing like a bridal veil.",
        "When Dr.",
        "Greenhill fetched down Cousin Henry Veeder, a bulky yet shy enough pre-Ford farmer in clean, faded overalls, then was Time again unbought, secure, serene.",
        "And the conversation had a comfortable triviality, an affectionate Victorian dullness.",
        "However Doremus might fret about \"conditions,\" however skittishly Sissy might long for the presence of her beaux, Julian Falck and Malcolm Tasbrough, there was nothing modern and neurotic, nothing savoring of Freud, Adler, Marx, Bertrand Russell, or any other divinity of the 1930's, when Mother Emma chattered to Mary and Merilla about her rose bushes that had \"winter-killed,\" and the new young maples that the field mice had gnawed, and the difficulty of getting Shad Ledue to bring in enough fireplace wood, and how Shad gorged pork chops and fried potatoes and pie at lunch, which he ate at the Jessups'.",
        "And the View.",
        "The women talked about the View as honeymooners once talked at Niagara Falls.",
        "David and Buck Titus were playing ship, now, on a rearing rock—it was the bridge, and David was Captain Popeye, with Buck his bosun; and even Dr.",
        "Greenhill, that impetuous crusader who was constantly infuriating the county board of health by reporting the slovenly state of the poor farm and the stench in the county jail, was lazy in the sun and with the greatest of concentration kept an unfortunate little ant running back and forth on a twig.",
        "His wife Mary—the golfer, the runner-up in state tennis tournaments, the giver of smart but not too bibulous cocktail parties at the country club, the wearer of smart brown tweeds with a green scarf—seemed to have dropped gracefully back into the domesticity of her mother, and to consider as a very weighty thing a recipe for celery-and- roquefort sandwiches on toasted soda crackers.",
        "She was the handsome Older Jessup Girl again, back in the white house with the mansard roof.",
        "And Foolish, lying on his back with his four paws idiotically flopping, was the most pastorally old-fashioned of them all.",
        "The only serious flare of conversation was when Buck Titus snarled to Doremus: \"Certainly a lot of Messiahs pottin' at you from the bushes these days—Buzz Windrip and Bishop Prang and Father Coughlin and Dr.",
        "Townsend (though he seems to have gone back to Nazareth) and Upton Sinclair and Rev.",
        "Frank Buchman and Bernarr Macfadden and Willum Randolph Hearst and Governor Talmadge and Floyd Olson and—Say, I swear the best Messiah in the whole show is this darky, Father Divine.",
        "He doesn't just promise he's going to feed the Under-privileged ten years from now—he hands out the fried drumsticks and gizzard right along with the Salvation.",
        "How about him for President?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of nowhere appeared Julian Falck.",
        "This young man, freshman in Amherst the past year, grandson of the Episcopal rector and living with the old man because his parents were dead, was in the eyes of Doremus the most nearly tolerable of Sissy's suitors.",
        "He was Swede-blond and wiry, with a neat, small face and canny eyes.",
        "He called Doremus \"sir,\" and he had, unlike most of the radio-and-motor-hypnotized eighteen-year-olds in the Fort, read a book, and voluntarily—read Thomas Wolfe and William Rollins, John Strachey and Stuart Chase and Ortega.",
        "Whether Sissy preferred him to Malcolm Tasbrough, her father did not know.",
        "Malcolm was taller and thicker than Julian, and he drove his own streamline De Soto, while Julian could only borrow his grandfather's shocking old flivver.",
        "Sissy and Julian bickered amiably about Alice Aylot's skill in backgammon, and Foolish scratched himself in the sun.",
        "But Doremus was not being pastoral.",
        "He was being anxious and scientific.",
        "While the others jeered, \"When does Dad take his audition?\" and \"What's he learning to be—a crooner or a hockey-announcer?\" Doremus was adjusting the doubtful portable radio.",
        "Once he thought he was going to be with them in the Home Sweet Home atmosphere, for he tuned in on a program of old songs, and all of them, including Cousin Henry Veeder, who had a hidden passion for fiddlers and barn dances and parlor organs, hummed \"Gaily the Troubadour\" and \"Maid of Athens\" and \"Darling Nelly Gray.\" But when the announcer informed them that these ditties were being sponsored by Toily Oily, the Natural Home Cathartic, and that they were being rendered by a sextette of young males horribly called \"The Smoothies,\" Doremus abruptly shut them off.",
        "\"Why, what's the matter, Dad?\" cried Sissy.",
        "\"'Smoothies'!",
        "God!",
        "This country deserves what it's going to get!\" snapped Doremus.",
        "\"Maybe we need a Buzz Windrip!\"\r\n\r\nThe moment, then—it should have been announced by cathedral chimes—of the weekly address of Bishop Paul Peter Prang.",
        "Coming from an airless closet, smelling of sacerdotal woolen union suits, in Persepolis, Indiana, it leapt to the farthest stars; it circled the world at 186,000 miles a second—a million miles while you stopped to scratch.",
        "It crashed into the cabin of a whaler on a dark polar sea; into an office, paneled with linen-fold oak looted from a Nottinghamshire castle, on the sixty-seventh story of a building on Wall Street; into the foreign office in Tokio; into the rocky hollow below the shining birches upon Mount Terror, in Vermont.",
        "Bishop Prang spoke, as he usually did, with a grave kindliness, a virile resonance, which made his self, magically coming to them on the unseen aerial pathway, at once dominating and touched with charm; and whatever his purposes might be, his words were on the side of the Angels:\r\n\r\n\"My friends of the radio audience, I shall have but six more weekly petitions to make you before the national conventions, which will decide the fate of this distraught nation, and the time has come now to act—to act!",
        "Enough of words!",

        "I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of this land, saith the Lord.",

        "For more than a year now, the League of Forgotten Men has warned the politicians, the whole government, that we are sick unto death of being the Dispossessed—and that, at last, we are more than fifty million strong; no whimpering horde, but with the will, the voices, the votes to enforce our sovereignty!",
        "We have in no uncertain way informed every politician that we demand—that we demand—certain measures, and that we will brook no delay.",
        "Again and again we have demanded that both the control of credit and the power to issue money be unqualifiedly taken away from the private banks; that the soldiers not only receive the bonus they with their blood and anguish so richly earned in '17 and '18, but that the amount agreed upon be now doubled; that all swollen incomes be severely limited and inheritances cut to such small sums as may support the heirs only in youth and in old age; that labor and farmers' unions be not merely recognized as instruments for joint bargaining but be made, like the syndicates in Italy, official parts of the government, representing the toilers; and that International Jewish Finance and, equally, International Jewish Communism and Anarchism and Atheism be, with all the stern solemnity and rigid inflexibility this great nation can show, barred from all activity.",
        "Those of you who have listened to me before will understand that I—or rather that the League of Forgotten Men—has no quarrel with individual Jews; that we are proud to have Rabbis among our directors; but those subversive international organizations which, unfortunately, are so largely Jewish, must be driven with whips and scorpions from off the face of the earth.",

        "When Doremus, back in the 1920's, had advocated the recognition of Russia, Fort Beulah had fretted that he was turning out-and-out Communist.",
        "He, who understood himself abnormally well, knew that far from being a left-wing radical, he was at most a mild, rather indolent and somewhat sentimental Liberal, who disliked pomposity, the heavy humor of public men, and the itch for notoriety which made popular preachers and eloquent educators and amateur play-producers and rich lady reformers and rich lady sportswomen and almost every brand of rich lady come preeningly in to see newspaper editors, with photographs under their arms, and on their faces the simper of fake humility.",
        "But for all cruelty and intolerance, and for the contempt of the fortunate for the unfortunate, he had not mere dislike but testy hatred.",
        "He had alarmed all his fellow editors in northern New England by asserting the innocence of Tom Mooney, questioning the guilt of Sacco and Vanzetti, condemning our intrusion in Haiti and Nicaragua, advocating an increased income tax, writing, in the 1932 campaign, a friendly account of the Socialist candidate, Norman Thomas (and afterwards, to tell the truth, voting for Franklin Roosevelt), and stirring up a little local and ineffective hell regarding the serfdom of the Southern sharecroppers and the California fruit-pickers.",
        "He even suggested editorially that when Russia had her factories and railroads and giant farms really going—say, in 1945—she might conceivably be the pleasantest country in the world for the (mythical!) Average Man.",

        "Crowley, he really did get into trouble.",
        "He got named Bolshevik, and in two days his paper lost a hundred and fifty out of its five thousand circulation.",
        "Yet he was as little of a Bolshevik as Herbert Hoover.",
        "He was, and he knew it, a small-town bourgeois Intellectual.",
        "Russia forbade everything that made his toil worth enduring: privacy, the right to think and to criticize as he freakishly pleased.",
        "To have his mind policed by peasants in uniform—rather than that he would live in an Alaska cabin, with beans and a hundred books and a new pair of pants every three years.",
        "Once, on a motor trip with Emma, he stopped in at a summer camp of Communists.",
        "Most of them were City College Jews or neat Bronx dentists, spectacled, and smooth-shaven except for foppish small mustaches.",
        "They were hot to welcome these New England peasants and to explain the Marxian gospel (on which, however, they furiously differed).",
        "Over macaroni and cheese in an unpainted dining shack, they longed for the black bread of Moscow.",
        "Later, Doremus chuckled to find how much they resembled the Y.M.C.A.",
        "campers twenty miles down the highway—equally Puritanical, hortatory, and futile, and equally given to silly games with rubber balls.",
        "Once only had he been dangerously active.",
        "He had supported the strike for union recognition against the quarry company of Francis Tasbrough.",
        "Men whom Doremus had known for years, solid cits like Superintendent of Schools Emil Staubmeyer, and Charley Betts of the furniture store, had muttered about \"riding him out of town on a rail.\" Tasbrough reviled him—even now, eight years later.",
        "After all this, the strike had been lost, and the strike-leader, an avowed Communist named Karl Pascal, had gone to prison for \"inciting to violence.\" When Pascal, best of mechanics, came out, he went to work in a littered little Fort Beulah garage owned by a friendly, loquacious, belligerent Polish Socialist named John Pollikop.",
        "All day long Pascal and Pollikop yelpingly raided each other's trenches in the battle between Social Democracy and Communism, and Doremus often dropped in to stir them up.",
        "That was hard for Tasbrough, Staubmeyer, Banker Crowley, and Lawyer Kitterick to bear.",
        "If Doremus had not come from three generations of debt-paying Vermonters, he would by now have been a penniless wandering printer...",
        "and possibly less detached about the Sorrows of the Dispossessed.",
        "The conservative Emma complained: \"How you can tease people this way, pretending you really like greasy mechanics like this Pascal (and I suspect you even have a sneaking fondness for Shad Ledue!) when you could just associate with decent, prosperous people like Frank—it's beyond me!",

        "THUNDER in the mountains, clouds marching down the Beulah Valley, unnatural darkness covering the world like black fog, and lightning that picked out ugly scarps of the hills as though they were rocks thrown up in an explosion.",
        "To such fury of the enraged heavens, Doremus awakened on that morning of late July.",
        "As abruptly as one who, in the death cell, startles out of sleep to the realization, \"Today they'll hang me!\" he sat up, bewildered, as he reflected that today Senator Berzelius Windrip would probably be nominated for President.",
        "The Republican convention was over, with Walt Trowbridge as presidential candidate.",
        "The Democratic convention, meeting in Cleveland, with a good deal of gin, strawberry soda, and sweat, had finished the committee reports, the kind words said for the Flag, the assurances to the ghost of Jefferson that he would be delighted by what, if Chairman Jim Farley consented, would be done here this week.",
        "They had come to the nominations—Senator Windrip had been nominated by Colonel Dewey Haik, Congressman, and power in the American Legion.",
        "Gratifying applause and hasty elimination had greeted such Favorite Sons of the several states as Al Smith, Carter Glass, William McAdoo, and Cordell Hull.",
        "Now, on the twelfth ballot, there were four contestants left, and they, in order of votes, were Senator Windrip, President Franklin D.",

        "In honor of Senator Robinson, the University of Arkansas brass band marched in behind a leader riding in an old horse-drawn buggy which was plastered with great placards proclaiming \"Save the Constitution\" and \"Robinson for Sanity.\" The name of Miss Perkins had been cheered for two hours, while the delegates marched with their state banners, and President Roosevelt's name had been cheered for three—cheered affectionately and quite homicidally, since every delegate knew that Mr.",
        "Roosevelt and Miss Perkins were far too lacking in circus tinsel and general clownishness to succeed at this critical hour of the nation's hysteria, when the electorate wanted a ringmaster-revolutionist like Senator Windrip.",
        "Windrip's own demonstration, scientifically worked up beforehand by his secretary-press-agent-private-philosopher, Lee Sarason, yielded nothing to others'.",
        "For Sarason had read his Chesterton well enough to know that there is only one thing bigger than a very big thing, and that is a thing so very small that it can be seen and understood.",
        "When Colonel Dewey Haik put Buzz's name in nomination, the Colonel wound up by shouting, \"One thing more!",
        "Listen!",
        "It is the special request of Senator Windrip that you do not waste the time of this history-making assembly by any cheering of his name—any cheering whatever.",
        "We of the League of Forgotten Men (yes—and Women!) don't want empty acclaim, but a solemn consideration of the desperate and immediate needs of 60 per cent of the population of the United States.",
        "No cheers—but may Providence guide us in the most solemn thinking we have ever done!\"\r\n\r\nAs he finished, down the center aisle came a private procession.",
        "But this was no parade of thousands.",
        "There were only thirty-one persons in it, and the only banners were three flags and two large placards.",
        "Leading it, in old blue uniforms, were two G.A.R.",
        "veterans, and between, arm-in-arm with them, a Confederate in gray.",
        "They were such very little old men, all over ninety, leaning one on another and glancing timidly about in the hope that no one would laugh at them.",
        "The Confederate carried a Virginia regimental banner, torn as by shrapnel; and one of the Union veterans lifted high a slashed flag of the First Minnesota.",
        "The dutiful applause which the convention had given to the demonstrations of other candidates had been but rain-patter compared with the tempest which greeted the three shaky, shuffling old men.",
        "On the platform the band played, inaudibly, \"Dixie,\" then \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again,\" and, standing on his chair midway of the auditorium, as a plain member of his state delegation, Buzz Windrip bowed—bowed—bowed and tried to smile, while tears started from his eyes and he sobbed helplessly, and the audience began to sob with him.",
        "Following the old men were twelve Legionnaires, wounded in 1918— stumbling on wooden legs, dragging themselves between crutches; one in a wheel chair, yet so young-looking and gay; and one with a black mask before what should have been a face.",
        "Of these, one carried an enormous flag, and another a placard demanding: \"Our Starving Families Must Have the Bonus—We Want Only Justice—We Want Buzz for President.\"\r\n\r\nAnd leading them, not wounded, but upright and strong and resolute, was Major General Hermann Meinecke, United States Army.",
        "Not in all the memory of the older reporters had a soldier on active service ever appeared as a public political agitator.",
        "The press whispered one to another, \"That general'll get canned, unless Buzz is elected—then he'd probably be made Duke of Hoboken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the soldiers were ten men and women, their toes through their shoes, and wearing rags that were the more pitiful because they had been washed and rewashed till they had lost all color.",
        "With them tottered four pallid children, their teeth rotted out, between them just managing to hold up a placard declaring, \"We Are on Relief.",
        "We Want to Become Human Beings Again.",
        "We Want Buzz!\"\r\n\r\nTwenty feet behind came one lone tall man.",
        "The delegates had been craning around to see what would follow the relief victims.",
        "When they did see, they rose, they bellowed, they clapped.",
        "For the lone man—Few of the crowd had seen him in the flesh; all of them had seen him a hundred times in press pictures, photographed among litters of books in his study—photographed in conference with President Roosevelt and Secretary Ickes—photographed shaking hands with Senator Windrip—photographed before a microphone, his shrieking mouth a dark open trap and his lean right arm thrown up in hysterical emphasis; all of them had heard his voice on the radio till they knew it as they knew the voices of their own brothers; all of them recognized, coming through the wide main entrance, at the end of the Windrip parade, the apostle of the Forgotten Men, Bishop Paul Peter Prang.",
        "Then the convention cheered Buzz Windrip for four unbroken hours.",
        "In the detailed descriptions of the convention which the news bureaus sent following the feverish first bulletins, one energetic Birmingham reporter pretty well proved that the Southern battle flag carried by the Confederate veteran had been lent by the museum in Richmond and the Northern flag by a distinguished meat-packer of Chicago who was the grandson of a Civil War general.",
        "Lee Sarason never told anyone save Buzz Windrip that both flags had been manufactured on Hester Street, New York, in 1929, for the patriotic drama, Morgan's Riding, and that both came from a theatrical warehouse.",
        "Before the cheering, as the Windrip parade neared the platform, they were greeted by Mrs.",
        "Adelaide Tarr Gimmitch, the celebrated author, lecturer, and composer, who—suddenly conjured onto the platform as if whisked out of the air—sang to the tune of \"Yankee Doodle\" words which she herself had written:\r\n\r\nBerzelius Windrip went to Wash.,\r\nA riding on a hobby—\r\nTo throw Big Business out, by Gosh,\r\nAnd be the People's Lobby!",
        "Chorus:\r\n\r\nBuzz and buzz and keep it up,\r\nOur cares and needs he's toting,\r\nYou are a most ungrateful pup,\r\nUnless for Buzz you're voting!",
        "The League of the Forgotten Men\r\nDon't like to be forgotten,\r\nThey went to Washington and then\r\nThey sang, \"There's something rotten!\"\r\n\r\nThat joyous battle song was sung on the radio by nineteen different prima donnas before midnight, by some sixteen million less vocal Americans within forty-eight hours, and by at least ninety million friends and scoffers in the struggle that was to come.",
        "All through the campaign, Buzz Windrip was able to get lots of jolly humor out of puns on going to Wash., and to wash.",
        "Walt Trowbridge, he jeered, wasn't going to either of them!",
        "Yet Lee Sarason knew that in addition to this comic masterpiece, the cause of Windrip required an anthem more elevated in thought and spirit, befitting the seriousness of crusading Americans.",
        "Long after the convention's cheering for Windrip had ended and the delegates were again at their proper business of saving the nation and cutting one another's throats, Sarason had Mrs.",
        "Gimmitch sing a more inspirational hymn, with words by Sarason himself, in collaboration with a quite remarkable surgeon, one Dr.",
        "Hector Macgoblin.",
        "This Dr.",
        "Macgoblin, soon to become a national monument, was as accomplished in syndicated medical journalism, in the reviewing of books about education and psychoanalysis, in preparing glosses upon the philosophies of Hegel, Professor Guenther, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, and Lothrop Stoddard, in the rendition of Mozart on the violin, in semi-professional boxing, and in the composition of epic poetry, as he was in the practice of medicine.",
        "Dr.",
        "Macgoblin!",
        "What a man!",
        "The Sarason-Macgoblin ode, entitled \"Bring Out the Old-time Musket,\" became to Buzz Windrip's band of liberators what \"Giovanezza\" was to the Italians, \"The Horst Wessel Song\" to the Nazis, \"The International\" to all Marxians.",
        "Along with the convention, the radio millions heard Mrs.",

        "Hm.\"\r\n\r\nThe thunderstorm, which had mercifully lulled, burst again in wrathful menace.",
        "All afternoon the convention balloted, over and over, with no change in the order of votes for the presidential candidate.",
        "Toward six, Miss Perkins's manager threw her votes to Roosevelt, who gained then on Senator Windrip.",
        "They seemed to have settled down to an all-night struggle, and at ten in the evening Doremus wearily left the office.",
        "He did not, tonight, want the sympathetic and extremely feminized atmosphere of his home, and he dropped in at the rectory of his friend Father Perefixe.",
        "There he found a satisfyingly unfeminized, untalcumized group.",
        "The Reverend Mr.",
        "Falck was there.",
        "Swart, sturdy young Perefixe and silvery old Falck often worked together, were fond of each other, and agreed upon the advantages of clerical celibacy and almost every other doctrine except the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome.",
        "With them were Buck Titus, Louis Rotenstern, Dr.",
        "Fowler Greenhill, and Banker Crowley, a financier who liked to cultivate an appearance of free intellectual discussion, though only after the hours devoted to refusing credit to desperate farmers and storekeepers.",
        "And not to be forgotten was Foolish the dog, who that thunderous morning had suspected his master's worry, followed him to the office, and all day long had growled at Haik and Sarason and Mrs.",
        "Gimmitch on the radio and showed an earnest conviction that he ought to chew up all flimsies reporting the convention.",
        "Better than his own glacial white-paneled drawing room with its portraits of dead Vermont worthies, Doremus liked Father Perefixe's little study, and its combination of churchliness, of freedom from Commerce (at least ordinary Commerce), as displayed in a crucifix and a plaster statuette of the Virgin and a shrieking red-and-green Italian picture of the Pope, with practical affairs, as shown in the oak roll-top desk and steel filing-cabinet and well-worn portable typewriter.",
        "It was a pious hermit's cave with the advantages of leather chairs and excellent rye highballs.",
        "The night passed as the eight of them (for Foolish too had his tipple of milk) all sipped and listened; the night passed as the convention balloted, furiously, unavailingly...",
        "that congress six hundred miles away, six hundred miles of befogged night, yet with every speech, every derisive yelp, coming into the priest's cabinet in the same second in which they were heard in the hall at Cleveland.",
        "Father Perefixe's housekeeper (who was sixty-five years old to his thirty-nine, to the disappointment of all the scandal-loving local Protestants) came in with scrambled eggs, cold beer.",
        "\"When my dear wife was still among us, she used to send me to bed at midnight,\" sighed Dr.",
        "Falck.",
        "\"My wife does now!\" said Doremus.",

        "\"Father Steve, here, and I are the only guys with a sensible way of living,\" crowed Buck Titus.",
        "\"Celibates.",
        "We can go to bed with our pants on, or not go to bed at all,\" and Father Perefixe murmured, \"But it's curious, Buck, what people find to boast of—you that you're free of God's tyranny and also that you can go to bed in your pants—Mr.",
        "Falck and Dr.",
        "Greenhill and I that God is so lenient with us that some nights He lets us off from sick-calls and we can go to bed with 'em off!",
        "And Louis because—Listen!",
        "Listen!",
        "Sounds like business!\"\r\n\r\nColonel Dewey Haik, Buzz's proposer, was announcing that Senator Windrip felt it would be only modest of him to go to his hotel now, but he had left a letter which he, Haik, would read.",
        "And he did read it, inexorably.",
        "Windrip stated that, just in case anyone did not completely understand his platform, he wanted to make it all ringingly clear.",
        "Summarized, the letter explained that he was all against the banks but all for the bankers—except the Jewish bankers, who were to be driven out of finance entirely; that he had thoroughly tested (but unspecified) plans to make all wages very high and the prices of everything produced by these same highly paid workers very low; that he was 100 per cent for Labor, but 100 per cent against all strikes; and that he was in favor of the United States so arming itself, so preparing to produce its own coffee, sugar, perfumes, tweeds, and nickel instead of importing them, that it could defy the World...",
        "and maybe, if that World was so impertinent as to defy America in turn, Buzz hinted, he might have to take it over and run it properly.",
        "Each moment the brassy importunities of the radio seemed to Doremus the more offensive, while the hillside slept in the heavy summer night, and he thought about the mazurka of the fireflies, the rhythm of crickets like the rhythm of the revolving earth itself, the voluptuous breezes that bore away the stink of cigars and sweat and whisky breaths and mint chewing-gum that seemed to come to them from the convention over the sound waves, along with the oratory.",
        "It was after dawn, and Father Perefixe (unclerically stripped to shirt-sleeves and slippers) had just brought them in a grateful tray of onion soup, with a gob of Hamburg steak for Foolish, when the opposition to Buzz collapsed and hastily, on the next ballot, Senator Berzelius Windrip was nominated as Democratic Candidate for President of the United States.",
        "Doremus, Buck Titus, Perefixe, and Falck were for a time too gloomy for speech—so possibly was the dog Foolish, as well, for at the turning off of the radio he tail-thumped in only the most tentative way.",
        "R.",
        "C.",
        "Crowley gloated, \"Well, all my life I've voted Republican, but here's a man that—Well, I'm going to vote for Windrip!\"\r\n\r\nFather Perefixe said tartly, \"And I've voted Democratic ever since I came from Canada and got naturalized, but this time I'm going to vote Republican.",
        "What about you fellows?\"\r\n\r\nRotenstern was silent.",
        "He did not like Windrip's reference to Jews.",
        "The ones he knew best—no, they were Americans!",
        "Lincoln was his tribal god too, he vowed.",
        "\"Me?",
        "I'll vote for Walt Trowbridge, of course,\" growled Buck.",

        "\"No!",
        "I won't either!",
        "Trowbridge won't have a chance.",
        "I think I'll indulge in the luxury of being independent, for once, and vote Prohibition or the Battle-Creek bran-and-spinach ticket, or anything that makes some sense!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was after seven that morning when Doremus came home, and, remarkably enough, Shad Ledue, who was supposed to go to work at seven, was at work at seven.",
        "Normally he never left his bachelor shack in Lower Town till ten to eight, but this morning he was on the job, chopping kindling.",
        "(Oh yes, reflected Doremus—that probably explained it.",
        "Kindling-chopping, if practised early enough, would wake up everyone in the house.)\r\n\r\nShad was tall and hulking; his shirt was sweat-stained; and as usual he needed a shave.",
        "Foolish growled at him.",
        "Doremus suspected that at some time he had been kicking Foolish.",
        "He wanted to honor Shad for the sweaty shirt, the honest toil, and all the rugged virtues, but even as a Liberal American Humanitarian, Doremus found it hard always to keep up the Longfellow's-Village-Blacksmith-cum-Marx attitude consistently and not sometimes backslide into a belief that there must be some crooks and swine among the toilers as, notoriously, there were so shockingly many among persons with more than $3500 a year.",
        "\"Well—been sitting up listening to the radio,\" purred Doremus.",
        "\"Did you know the Democrats have nominated Senator Windrip?\"\r\n\r\n\"That so?\" Shad growled.",
        "\"Yes.",
        "Just now.",

        "Jessup.\" Shad struck an attitude, leaning on his ax.",
        "Sometimes he could be quite pleasant and condescending, even to this little man who was so ignorant about coon-hunting and the games of craps and poker.",
        "\"I'm going to vote for Buzz Windrip.",
        "He's going to fix it so everybody will get four thousand bucks, immediate, and I'm going to start a chicken farm.",
        "I can make a bunch of money out of chickens!",
        "I'll show some of these guys that think they're so rich!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Shad, you didn't have so much luck with chickens when you tried to raise 'em in the shed back there.",
        "You, uh, I'm afraid you sort of let their water freeze up on 'em in winter, and they all died, you remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, them?",
        "So what!",
        "Heck!",
        "There was too few of 'em.",

        "You bet.\" And, most patronizingly: \"Buzz Windrip is O.K.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad he has your imprimatur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh?\" said Shad, and scowled.",
        "But as Doremus plodded up on the back porch he heard from Shad a faint derisive:\r\n\r\n\"O.K., Chief!\"\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nI DON'T pretend to be a very educated man, except maybe educated in the heart, and in being able to feel for the sorrows and fear of every ornery fellow human being.",
        "Still and all, I've read the Bible through, from kiver to kiver, like my wife's folks say down in Arkansas, some eleven times; I've read all the law books they've printed; and as to contemporaries, I don't guess I've missed much of all the grand literature produced by Bruce Barton, Edgar Guest, Arthur Brisbane, Elizabeth Dilling, Walter Pitkin, and William Dudley Pelley.",
        "This last gentleman I honor not only for his rattling good yarns, and his serious work in investigating life beyond the grave and absolutely proving that only a blind fool could fail to believe in Personal Immortality, but, finally, for his public-spirited and self-sacrificing work in founding the Silver Shirts.",
        "These true knights, even if they did not attain quite all the success they deserved, were one of our most noble and Galahad-like attempts to combat the sneaking, snaky, sinister, surreptitious, seditious plots of the Red Radicals and other sour brands of Bolsheviks that incessantly threaten the American standards of Liberty, High Wages, and Universal Security.",

        "Thereafter, as soon as may be practicable, this said Board shall consider the nationalization and government-ownership, for the Profit of the Whole People, of all mines, oilfields, water power, public utilities, transportation, and communication.",
        "(2) The President shall appoint a commission, equally divided between manual workers, employers, and representatives of the Public, to determine which Labor Unions are qualified to represent the Workers; and report to the Executive, for legal action, all pretended labor organizations, whether \"Company Unions,\" or \"Red Unions,\" controlled by Communists and the so-called \"Third International.\" The duly recognized Unions shall be constituted Bureaus of the Government, with power of decision in all labor disputes.",
        "Later, the same investigation and official recognition shall be extended to farm organizations.",
        "In this elevation of the position of the Worker, it shall be emphasized that the League of Forgotten Men is the chief bulwark against the menace of destructive and un-American Radicalism.",
        "(3) In contradistinction to the doctrines of Red Radicals, with their felonious expropriation of the arduously acquired possessions which insure to aged persons their security, this League and Party will guarantee Private Initiative and the Right to Private Property for all time.",
        "(4) Believing that only under God Almighty, to Whom we render all homage, do we Americans hold our vast Power, we shall guarantee to all persons absolute freedom of religious worship, provided, however, that no atheist, agnostic, believer in Black Magic, nor any Jew who shall refuse to swear allegiance to the New Testament, nor any person of any faith who refuses to take the Pledge to the Flag, shall be permitted to hold any public office or to practice as a teacher, professor, lawyer, judge, or as a physician, except in the category of Obstetrics.",
        "(5) Annual net income per person shall be limited to $500,000.",
        "No accumulated fortune may at any one time exceed $3,000,000 per person.",
        "No one person shall, during his entire lifetime, be permitted to retain an inheritance or various inheritances in total exceeding $2,000,000.",
        "All incomes or estates in excess of the sums named shall be seized by the Federal Government for use in Relief and in Administrative expenses.",
        "(6) Profit shall be taken out of War by seizing all dividends over and above 6 per cent that shall be received from the manufacture, distribution, or sale, during Wartime, of all arms, munitions, aircraft, ships, tanks, and all other things directly applicable to warfare, as well as from food, textiles, and all other supplies furnished to the American or to any allied army.",
        "(7) Our armaments and the size of our military and naval establishments shall be consistently enlarged until they shall equal, but—since this country has no desire for foreign conquest of any kind—not surpass, in every branch of the forces of defense, the martial strength of any other single country or empire in the world.",
        "Upon inauguration, this League and Party shall make this its first obligation, together with the issuance of a firm proclamation to all nations of the world that our armed forces are to be maintained solely for the purpose of insuring world peace and amity.",
        "(8) Congress shall have the sole right to issue money and immediately upon our inauguration it shall at least double the present supply of money, in order to facilitate the fluidity of credit.",
        "(9) We cannot too strongly condemn the un-Christian attitude of certain otherwise progressive nations in their discriminations against the Jews, who have been among the strongest supporters of the League, and who will continue to prosper and to be recognized as fully Americanized, though only so long as they continue to support our ideals.",
        "(10) All Negroes shall be prohibited from voting, holding public office, practicing law, medicine, or teaching in any class above the grade of grammar school, and they shall be taxed 100 per cent of all sums in excess of $10,000 per family per year which they may earn or in any other manner receive.",
        "In order, however, to give the most sympathetic aid possible to all Negroes who comprehend their proper and valuable place in society, all such colored persons, male or female, as can prove that they have devoted not less than forty-five years to such suitable tasks as domestic service, agricultural labor, and common labor in industries, shall at the age of sixty-five be permitted to appear before a special Board, composed entirely of white persons, and upon proof that while employed they have never been idle except through sickness, they shall be recommended for pensions not to exceed the sum of $500.00 per person per year, nor to exceed $700.00 per family.",
        "Negroes shall, by definition, be persons with at least one sixteenth colored blood.",
        "(11) Far from opposing such high-minded and economically sound methods of the relief of poverty, unemployment, and old age as the epic plan of the Hon.",
        "Upton Sinclair, the \"Share the Wealth\" and \"Every Man a King\" proposals of the late Hon.",
        "Huey Long to assure every family $5000 a year, the Townsend plan, the Utopian plan, Technocracy, and all competent schemes of unemployment insurance, a Commission shall immediately be appointed by the New Administration to study, reconcile, and recommend for immediate adoption the best features in these several plans for Social Security, and the Hon.",
        "Messrs.",
        "Sinclair, Townsend, Eugene Reed, and Howard Scott are herewith invited to in every way advise and collaborate with that Commission.",
        "(12) All women now employed shall, as rapidly as possible, except in such peculiarly feminine spheres of activity as nursing and beauty parlors, be assisted to return to their incomparably sacred duties as home-makers and as mothers of strong, honorable future Citizens of the Commonwealth.",
        "(13) Any person advocating Communism, Socialism, or Anarchism, advocating refusal to enlist in case of war, or advocating alliance with Russia in any war whatsoever, shall be subject to trial for high treason, with a minimum penalty of twenty years at hard labor in prison, and a maximum of death on the gallows, or other form of execution which the judges may find convenient.",
        "(14) All bonuses promised to former soldiers of any war in which America has ever engaged shall be immediately paid in full, in cash, and in all cases of veterans with incomes of less than $5,000.00 a year, the formerly promised sums shall be doubled.",
        "(15) Congress shall, immediately upon our inauguration, initiate amendments to the Constitution providing (a), that the President shall have the authority to institute and execute all necessary measures for the conduct of the government during this critical epoch; (b), that Congress shall serve only in an advisory capacity, calling to the attention of the President and his aides and Cabinet any needed legislation, but not acting upon same until authorized by the President so to act; and (c), that the Supreme Court shall immediately have removed from its jurisdiction the power to negate, by ruling them to be unconstitutional or by any other judicial action, any or all acts of the President, his duly appointed aides, or Congress.",
        "Addendum: It shall be strictly understood that, as the League of Forgotten Men and the Democratic Party, as now constituted, have no purpose nor desire to carry out any measure that shall not unqualifiedly meet with the desire of the majority of voters in these United States, the League and Party regard none of the above fifteen points as obligatory and unmodifiable except No.",
        "15, and upon the others they will act or refrain from acting in accordance with the general desire of the Public, who shall under the new régime be again granted an individual freedom of which they have been deprived by the harsh and restrictive economic measures of former administrations, both Republican and Democratic.",
        "\"But what does it mean?\" marveled Mrs.",
        "Jessup, when her husband had read the platform to her.",
        "\"It's so inconsistent.",
        "Sounds like a combination of Norman Thomas and Calvin Coolidge.",
        "I don't seem to understand it.",
        "I wonder if Mr.",
        "Windrip understands it himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.",
        "You bet he does.",
        "It mustn't be supposed that because Windrip gets that intellectual dressmaker Sarason to prettify his ideas up for him he doesn't recognize 'em and clasp 'em to his bosom when they're dolled up in two-dollar words.",
        "I'll tell you just what it all means: Articles One and Five mean that if the financiers and transportation kings and so on don't come through heavily with support for Buzz they may be threatened with bigger income taxes and some control of their businesses.",
        "But they are coming through, I hear, handsomely—they're paying for Buzz's radio and his parades.",
        "Two, that by controlling their unions directly, Buzz's gang can kidnap all Labor into slavery.",
        "Three backs up the security for Big Capital and Four brings the preachers into line as scared and unpaid press-agents for Buzz.",
        "\"Six doesn't mean anything at all—munition firms with vertical trusts will be able to wangle one 6 per cent on manufacture, one on transportation, and one on sales—at least.",
        "Seven means we'll get ready to follow all the European nations in trying to hog the whole world.",
        "Eight means that by inflation, big industrial companies will be able to buy their outstanding bonds back at a cent on the dollar, and Nine that all Jews who don't cough up plenty of money for the robber baron will be punished, even including the Jews who haven't much to cough up.",
        "Ten, that all well-paying jobs and businesses held by Negroes will be grabbed by the Poor White Trash among Buzz's worshipers—and that instead of being denounced they'll be universally praised as patriotic protectors of Racial Purity.",
        "Eleven, that Buzz'll be able to pass the buck for not creating any real relief for poverty.",
        "Twelve, that women will later lose the vote and the right to higher education and be foxed out of all decent jobs and urged to rear soldiers to be killed in foreign wars.",
        "Thirteen, that anybody who opposes Buzz in any way at all can be called a Communist and scragged for it.",
        "Why, under this clause, Hoover and Al Smith and Ogden Mills—yes, and you and me—will all be Communists.",
        "\"Fourteen, that Buzz thinks enough of the support of the veterans' vote to be willing to pay high for it—in other people's money.",
        "And Fifteen—well, that's the one lone clause that really does mean something; and it means that Windrip and Lee Sarason and Bishop Prang and I guess maybe this Colonel Dewey Haik and this Dr.",
        "Hector Macgoblin—you know, this doctor that helps write the high-minded hymns for Buzz—they've realized that this country has gone so flabby that any gang daring enough and unscrupulous enough, and smart enough not to seem illegal, can grab hold of the entire government and have all the power and applause and salutes, all the money and palaces and willin' women they want.",
        "\"They're only a handful, but just think how small Lenin's gang was at first, and Mussolini's, and Hitler's, and Kemal Pasha's, and Napoleon's!",
        "You'll see all the liberal preachers and modernist educators and discontented newspapermen and farm agitators—maybe they'll worry at first, but they'll get caught up in the web of propaganda, like we all were in the Great War, and they'll all be convinced that, even if our Buzzy maybe has got a few faults, he's on the side of the plain people, and against all the tight old political machines, and they'll rouse the country for him as the Great Liberator (and meanwhile Big Business will just wink and sit tight!) and then, by God, this crook—oh, I don't know whether he's more of a crook or an hysterical religious fanatic—along with Sarason and Haik and Prang and Macgoblin—these five men will be able to set up a régime that'll remind you of Henry Morgan the pirate capturing a merchant ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will Americans stand for it long?\" whimpered Emma.",
        "\"Oh, no, not people like us—the descendants of the pioneers!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dunno.",
        "I'm going to try help see that they don't....",
        "Of course you understand that you and I and Sissy and Fowler and Mary will probably be shot if I do try to do anything....",
        "Hm!",
        "I sound brave enough now, but probably I'll be scared to death when I hear Buzz's private troops go marching by!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you will be careful, won't you?\" begged Emma.",
        "\"Oh.",
        "Before I forget it.",
        "How many times must I tell you, Dormouse, not to give Foolish chicken bones—they'll stick in his poor throat and choke him to death.",
        "And you just never remember to take the keys out of the car when you put it in the garage at night!",
        "I'm perfectly sure Shad Ledue or somebody will steal it one of these nights!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFather Stephen Perefixe, when he read the Fifteen Points, was considerably angrier than Doremus.",
        "He snorted, \"What?",
        "Negroes, Jews, women—they all banned and they leave us Catholics out, this time?",
        "Hitler didn't neglect us.",
        "He's persecuted us.",
        "Must be that Charley Coughlin.",
        "He's made us too respectable!\"\r\n\r\nSissy, who was eager to go to a school of architecture and become a creator of new styles in houses of glass and steel; Lorinda Pike, who had plans for a Carlsbad-Vichy-Saratoga in Vermont; Mrs.",
        "Candy, who aspired to a home bakery of her own when she should be too old for domestic labor—they were all of them angrier than either Doremus or Father Perefixe.",
        "Sissy sounded not like a flirtatious girl but like a battling woman as she snarled, \"So the League of Forgotten Men is going to make us a League of Forgotten Women!",
        "Send us back to washing diapers and leaching out ashes for soap!",
        "Let us read Louisa May Alcott and Barne—except on the Sabbath, of course!",
        "Let us sleep in humble gratitude with men—\"\r\n\r\n\"Sissy!\" wailed her mother.",
        "\"—like Shad Ledue!",
        "Well, Dad, you can sit right down and write Busy Berzelius for me that I'm going to England on the next boat!\"\r\n\r\nMrs.",
        "Candy stopped drying the water glasses (with the soft dishtowels which she scrupulously washed out daily) long enough to croak, \"What nasty men!",
        "I do hope they get shot soon,\" which for Mrs.",
        "Candy was a startlingly long and humanitarian statement.",
        "\"Yes.",
        "Nasty enough.",
        "But what I've got to keep remembering is that Windrip is only the lightest cork on the whirlpool.",
        "He didn't plot all this thing.",
        "With all the justified discontent there is against the smart politicians and the Plush Horses of Plutocracy—oh, if it hadn't been one Windrip, it'd been another....",
        "We had it coming, we Respectables....",
        "But that isn't going to make us like it!\" thought Doremus.",
        "CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHOSE who have never been on the inside in the Councils of State can never realize that with really high-class Statesmen, their chief quality is not political canniness, but a big, rich, overflowing Love for all sorts and conditions of people and for the whole land.",
        "That Love and that Patriotism have been my sole guiding principles in Politics.",
        "My one ambition is to get all Americans to realize that they are, and must continue to be, the greatest Race on the face of this old Earth, and second, to realize that whatever apparent Differences there may be among us, in wealth, knowledge, skill, ancestry or strength—though, of course, all this does not apply to people who are racially different from us—we are all brothers, bound together in the great and wonderful bond of National Unity, for which we should all be very glad.",
        "And I think we ought to for this be willing to sacrifice any individual gains at all.",
        "Zero Hour, Berzelius Windrip.",
        "BERZELIUS WINDRIP, of whom in late summer and early autumn of 1936 there were so many published photographs—showing him popping into cars and out of aeroplanes, dedicating bridges, eating corn pone and side-meat with Southerners and clam chowder and bran with Northerners, addressing the American Legion, the Liberty League, the Y.M.H.A., the Young People's Socialist League, the Elks, the Bartenders' and Waiters' Union, the Anti-Saloon League, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Afghanistan—showing him kissing lady centenarians and shaking hands with ladies called Madame, but never the opposite—showing him in Savile Row riding-clothes on Long Island and in overalls and a khaki shirt in the Ozarks—this Buzz Windrip was almost a dwarf, yet with an enormous head, a bloodhound head, of huge ears, pendulous cheeks, mournful eyes.",
        "He had a luminous, ungrudging smile which (declared the Washington correspondents) he turned on and off deliberately, like an electric light, but which could make his ugliness more attractive than the simpers of any pretty man.",
        "His hair was so coarse and black and straight, and worn so long in the back, that it hinted of Indian blood.",
        "In the Senate he preferred clothes that suggested the competent insurance salesman, but when farmer constituents were in Washington he appeared in an historic ten-gallon hat with a mussy gray \"cutaway\" which somehow you erroneously remembered as a black \"Prince Albert.\"\r\n\r\nIn that costume, he looked like a sawed-off museum model of a medicine-show \"doctor,\" and indeed it was rumored that during one law-school vacation Buzz Windrip had played the banjo and done card tricks and handed down medicine bottles and managed the shell game for no less scientific an expedition than Old Dr.",
        "Alagash's Traveling Laboratory, which specialized in the Choctaw Cancer Cure, the Chinook Consumption Soother, and the Oriental Remedy for Piles and Rheumatism Prepared from a World-old Secret Formula by the Gipsy Princess, Queen Peshawara.",
        "The company, ardently assisted by Buzz, killed off quite a number of persons who, but for their confidence in Dr.",
        "Alagash's bottles of water, coloring matter, tobacco juice, and raw corn whisky, might have gone early enough to doctors.",
        "But since then, Windrip had redeemed himself, no doubt, by ascending from the vulgar fraud of selling bogus medicine, standing in front of a megaphone, to the dignity of selling bogus economics, standing on an indoor platform under mercury-vapor lights in front of a microphone.",
        "He was in stature but a small man, yet remember that so were Napoleon, Lord Beaverbrook, Stephen A.",
        "Douglas, Frederick the Great, and the Dr.",
        "Goebbels who is privily known throughout Germany as \"Wotan's Mickey Mouse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDoremus Jessup, so inconspicuous an observer, watching Senator Windrip from so humble a Boeotia, could not explain his power of bewitching large audiences.",
        "The Senator was vulgar, almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his \"ideas\" almost idiotic, while his celebrated piety was that of a traveling salesman for church furniture, and his yet more celebrated humor the sly cynicism of a country store.",
        "Certainly there was nothing exhilarating in the actual words of his speeches, nor anything convincing in his philosophy.",
        "His political platforms were only wings of a windmill.",
        "Seven years before his present credo—derived from Lee Sarason, Hitler, Gottfried Feder, Rocco, and probably the revue Of Thee I Sing—little Buzz, back home, had advocated nothing more revolutionary than better beef stew in the county poor-farms, and plenty of graft for loyal machine politicians, with jobs for their brothers-in-law, nephews, law partners, and creditors.",
        "Doremus had never heard Windrip during one of his orgasms of oratory, but he had been told by political reporters that under the spell you thought Windrip was Plato, but that on the way home you could not remember anything he had said.",
        "There were two things, they told Doremus, that distinguished this prairie Demosthenes.",
        "He was an actor of genius.",
        "There was no more overwhelming actor on the stage, in the motion pictures, nor even in the pulpit.",
        "He would whirl arms, bang tables, glare from mad eyes, vomit Biblical wrath from a gaping mouth; but he would also coo like a nursing mother, beseech like an aching lover, and in between tricks would coldly and almost contemptuously jab his crowds with figures and facts—figures and facts that were inescapable even when, as often happened, they were entirely incorrect.",
        "But below this surface stagecraft was his uncommon natural ability to be authentically excited by and with his audience, and they by and with him.",
        "He could dramatize his assertion that he was neither a Nazi nor a Fascist but a Democrat—a homespun Jeffersonian-Lincolnian-Clevelandian-Wilsonian Democrat—and (sans scenery and costume) make you see him veritably defending the Capitol against barbarian hordes, the while he innocently presented as his own warm-hearted Democratic inventions, every anti-libertarian, anti-Semitic madness of Europe.",
        "Aside from his dramatic glory, Buzz Windrip was a Professional Common Man.",
        "Oh, he was common enough.",
        "He had every prejudice and aspiration of every American Common Man.",
        "He believed in the desirability and therefore the sanctity of thick buckwheat cakes with adulterated maple syrup, in rubber trays for the ice cubes in his electric refrigerator, in the especial nobility of dogs, all dogs, in the oracles of S.",
        "Parkes Cadman, in being chummy with all waitresses at all junction lunch rooms, and in Henry Ford (when he became President, he exulted, maybe he could get Mr.",
        "Ford to come to supper at the White House), and the superiority of anyone who possessed a million dollars.",
        "He regarded spats, walking sticks, caviar, titles, tea-drinking, poetry not daily syndicated in newspapers and all foreigners, possibly excepting the British, as degenerate.",
        "But he was the Common Man twenty-times-magnified by his oratory, so that while the other Commoners could understand his every purpose, which was exactly the same as their own, they saw him towering among them, and they raised hands to him in worship.",
        "In the greatest of all native American arts (next to the talkies, and those Spirituals in which Negroes express their desire to go to heaven, to St.",
        "Louis, or almost any place distant from the romantic old plantations), namely, in the art of Publicity, Lee Sarason was in no way inferior even to such acknowledged masters as Edward Bernays, the late Theodore Roosevelt, Jack Dempsey, and Upton Sinclair.",
        "Sarason had, as it was scientifically called, been \"building up\" Senator Windrip for seven years before his nomination as President.",
        "Where other Senators were encouraged by their secretaries and wives (no potential dictator ought ever to have a visible wife, and none ever has had, except Napoleon) to expand from village back-slapping to noble, rotund, Ciceronian gestures, Sarason had encouraged Windrip to keep up in the Great World all of the clownishness which (along with considerable legal shrewdness and the endurance to make ten speeches a day) had endeared him to his simple-hearted constituents in his native state.",
        "Windrip danced a hornpipe before an alarmed academic audience when he got his first honorary degree; he kissed Miss Flandreau at the South Dakota beauty contest; he entertained the Senate, or at least the Senate galleries, with detailed accounts of how to catch catfish—from the bait-digging to the ultimate effects of the jug of corn whisky; he challenged the venerable Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to a duel with sling-shots.",
        "Though she was not visible, Windrip did have a wife—Sarason had none, nor was likely to; and Walt Trowbridge was a widower.",
        "Buzz's lady stayed back home, raising spinach and chickens and telling the neighbors that she expected to go to Washington next year, the while Windrip was informing the press that his \"Frau\" was so edifyingly devoted to their two small children and to Bible study that she simply could not be coaxed to come East.",
        "But when it came to assembling a political machine, Windrip had no need of counsel from Lee Sarason.",
        "Where Buzz was, there were the vultures also.",
        "His hotel suite, in the capital city of his home state, in Washington, in New York, or in Kansas City, was like—well, Frank Sullivan once suggested that it resembled the office of a tabloid newspaper upon the impossible occasion of Bishop Cannon's setting fire to St.",
        "Patrick's Cathedral, kidnaping the Dionne quintuplets, and eloping with Greta Garbo in a stolen tank.",
        "In the \"parlor\" of any of these suites, Buzz Windrip sat in the middle of the room, a telephone on the floor beside him, and for hours he shrieked at the instrument, \"Hello—yuh—speaking,\" or at the door, \"Come in—come in!\" and \"Sit down 'n' take a load off your feet!\" All day, all night till dawn, he would be bellowing, \"Tell him he can take his bill and go climb a tree,\" or \"Why certainly, old man—tickled to death to support it—utility corporations cer'nly been getting a raw deal,\" and \"You tell the Governor I want Kippy elected sheriff and I want the indictment against him quashed and I want it damn quick!\" Usually, squatted there cross-legged, he would be wearing a smart belted camel's-hair coat with an atrocious checked cap.",
        "In a fury, as he was at least every quarter hour, he would leap up, peel off the overcoat (showing either a white boiled shirt and clerical black bow, or a canary-yellow silk shirt with a scarlet tie), fling it on the floor, and put it on again with slow dignity, while he bellowed his anger like Jeremiah cursing Jerusalem, or like a sick cow mourning its kidnaped young.",
        "There came to him stockbrokers, labor leaders, distillers, anti- vivisectionists, vegetarians, disbarred shyster lawyers, missionaries to China, lobbyists for oil and electricity, advocates of war and of war against war.",
        "\"Gaw!",
        "Every guy in the country with a bad case of the gimmes comes to see me!\" he growled to Sarason.",
        "He promised to further their causes, to get an appointment to West Point for the nephew who had just lost his job in the creamery.",
        "He promised fellow politicians to support their bills if they would support his.",
        "He gave interviews upon subsistence farming, backless bathing suits, and the secret strategy of the Ethiopian army.",
        "He grinned and knee-patted and back-slapped; and few of his visitors, once they had talked with him, failed to look upon him as their Little Father and to support him forever....",
        "The few who did fail, most of them newspapermen, disliked the smell of him more than before they had met him....",
        "Even they, by the unusual spiritedness and color of their attacks upon him, kept his name alive in every column....",
        "By the time he had been a Senator for one year, his machine was as complete and smooth-running—and as hidden away from ordinary passengers—as the engines of a liner.",
        "On the beds in any of his suites there would, at the same time, repose three top-hats, two clerical hats, a green object with a feather, a brown derby, a taxi-driver's cap, and nine ordinary, Christian brown felts.",
        "Once, within twenty-seven minutes, he talked on the telephone from Chicago to Palo Alto, Washington, Buenos Aires, Wilmette, and Oklahoma City.",
        "Once, in half a day, he received sixteen calls from clergymen asking him to condemn the dirty burlesque show, and seven from theatrical promoters and real-estate owners asking him to praise it.",
        "He called the clergymen \"Doctor\" or \"Brother\" or both; he called the promoters \"Buddy\" and \"Pal\"; he gave equally ringing promises to both; and for both he loyally did nothing whatever.",
        "Normally, he would not have thought of cultivating foreign alliances, though he never doubted that some day, as President, he would be leader of the world orchestra.",
        "Lee Sarason insisted that Buzz look into a few international fundamentals, such as the relationship of sterling to the lira, the proper way in which to address a baronet, the chances of the Archduke Otto, the London oyster bars and the brothels near the Boulevard de Sebastopol best to recommend to junketing Representatives.",
        "But the actual cultivation of foreign diplomats resident in Washington he left to Sarason, who entertained them on terrapin and canvasback duck with black-currant jelly, in his apartment that was considerably more tapestried than Buzz's own ostentatiously simple Washington quarters....",
        "However, in Sarason's place, a room with a large silk-hung Empire double bed was reserved for Buzz.",
        "It was Sarason who had persuaded Windrip to let him write Zero Hour, based on Windrip's own dictated notes, and who had beguiled millions into reading—and even thousands into buying—that Bible of Economic Justice; Sarason who had perceived there was now such a spate of private political weeklies and monthlies that it was a distinction not to publish one; Sarason who had the inspiration for Buzz's emergency radio address at 3 A.M.",
        "upon the occasion of the Supreme Court's throttling the N.R.A., in May, 1935....",
        "Though not many adherents, including Buzz himself, were quite certain as to whether he was pleased or disappointed; though not many actually heard the broadcast itself, everyone in the country except sheep- herders and Professor Albert Einstein heard about it and was impressed.",
        "Yet it was Buzz who all by himself thought of first offending the Duke of York by refusing to appear at the Embassy dinner for him in December, 1935, thus gaining, in all farm kitchens and parsonages and barrooms, a splendid reputation for Homespun Democracy; and of later mollifying His Highness by calling on him with a touching little home bouquet of geraniums (from the hothouse of the Japanese ambassador), which endeared him, if not necessarily to Royalty yet certainly to the D.A.R., the English-Speaking Union, and all motherly hearts who thought the pudgy little bunch of geraniums too sweet for anything.",
        "By the newspapermen Buzz was credited with having insisted on the nomination of Perley Beecroft for vice-president at the Democratic convention, after Doremus Jessup had frenetically ceased listening.",
        "Beecroft was a Southern tobacco-planter and storekeeper, an ex-Governor of his state, married to an ex-schoolteacher from Maine who was sufficiently scented with salt spray and potato blossoms to win any Yankee.",
        "But it was not his geographical superiority which made Mr.",
        "Beecroft the perfect running mate for Buzz Windrip but that he was malaria-yellowed and laxly mustached, where Buzz's horsey face was ruddy and smooth; while Beecroft's oratory had a vacuity, a profundity of slowly enunciated nonsense, which beguiled such solemn deacons as were irritated by Buzz's cataract of slang.",
        "Nor could Sarason ever have convinced the wealthy that the more Buzz denounced them and promised to distribute their millions to the poor, the more they could trust his \"common sense\" and finance his campaign.",
        "But with a hint, a grin, a wink, a handshake, Buzz could convince them, and their contributions came in by the hundred thousand, often disguised as assessments on imaginary business partnerships.",
        "It had been the peculiar genius of Berzelius Windrip not to wait until he should be nominated for this office or that to begin shanghaiing his band of buccaneers.",
        "He had been coaxing in supporters ever since the day when, at the age of four, he had captivated a neighborhood comrade by giving him an ammonia pistol which later he thriftily stole back from the comrade's pocket.",
        "Buzz might not have learned, perhaps could not have learned, much from sociologists Charles Beard and John Dewey, but they could have learned a great deal from Buzz.",
        "And it was Buzz's, not Sarason's, master stroke that, as warmly as he advocated everyone's getting rich by just voting to be rich, he denounced all \"Fascism\" and \"Nazi-ism,\" so that most of the Republicans who were afraid of Democratic Fascism, and all the Democrats who were afraid of Republican Fascism, were ready to vote for him.",
        "CHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWHILE I hate befogging my pages with scientific technicalities and even neologies, I feel constrained to say here that the most elementary perusal of the Economy of Abundance would convince any intelligent student that the Cassandras who miscall the much-needed increase in the fluidity of our currential circulation \"Inflation,\" erroneously basing their parallel upon the inflationary misfortunes of certain European nations in the era 1919-1923, fallaciously and perhaps inexcusably fail to comprehend the different monetary status in America inherent in our vastly greater reservoir of Natural Resources.",

        "Besides these necessitous petitioners, a goodish number of burghers who, while they were millionaires, yet maintained that their prosperity had been sorely checked by the fiendishness of the bankers in limiting their credit.",
        "These were the supporters who looked to Berzelius Windrip to play the divine raven and feed them handsomely when he should become President, and from such came most of the fervid elocutionists who campaigned for him through September and October.",
        "Pushing in among this mob of camp followers who identified political virtue with money for their rent came a flying squad who suffered not from hunger but from congested idealism: Intellectuals and Reformers and even Rugged Individualists, who saw in Windrip, for all his clownish swindlerism, a free vigor which promised a rejuvenation of the crippled and senile capitalistic system.",
        "Upton Sinclair wrote about Buzz and spoke for him just as in 1917, unyielding pacifist though he was, Mr.",
        "Sinclair had advocated America's whole-hearted prosecution of the Great War, foreseeing that it would unquestionably exterminate German militarism and thus forever end all wars.",
        "Most of the Morgan partners, though they may have shuddered a little at association with Upton Sinclair, saw that, however much income they themselves might have to sacrifice, only Windrip could start the Business Recovery; while Bishop Manning of New York City pointed out that Windrip always spoke reverently of the church and its shepherds, whereas Walt Trowbridge went horseback-riding every Sabbath morning and had never been known to telegraph any female relative on Mother's Day.",
        "On the other hand, the Saturday Evening Post enraged the small shopkeepers by calling Wmdrip a demagogue, and the New York Times, once Independent Democrat, was anti-Windrip.",

        "Buzz himself, Bishop Prang, Senator Porkwood (the fearless Liberal and friend of labor and the farmers), and Colonel Osceola Luthorne, the editor, though their prime task was reaching millions by radio, also, in a forty-day tram trip, traveled over 27,000 miles, through every state in the Union, on the scarlet-and-silver, ebony-paneled, silk-upholstered, streamlined, Diesel-engined, rubber-padded, air-conditioned, aluminum Forgotten Men Special.",

        "Returned to America, he had been elected to Congress, and become a colonel in the militia.",

        "Forty-eight hours after the nomination of Windrip at Cleveland, President Roosevelt had issued his defiance.",
        "Senator Windrip, he asserted, had been chosen \"not by the brains and hearts of genuine Democrats but by their temporarily crazed emotions.\" He would no more support Windrip because he claimed to be a Democrat than he would support Jimmy Walker.",

        "Buzz Windrip aroused mirth by dubbing it the \"Bull Mouse Party,\" but President Roosevelt was joined by almost all the liberal members of Congress, Democratic or Republican, who had not followed Walt Trowbridge; by Norman Thomas and the Socialists who had not turned Communist; by Governors Floyd Olson and Olin Johnston; and by Mayor La Guardia.",
        "The conspicuous fault of the Jeffersonian Party, like the personal fault of Senator Trowbridge, was that it represented integrity and reason, in a year when the electorate hungered for frisky emotions, for the peppery sensations associated, usually, not with monetary systems and taxation rates but with baptism by immersion in the creek, young love under the elms, straight whisky, angelic orchestras heard soaring down from the full moon, fear of death when an automobile teeters above a canyon, thirst in a desert and quenching it with spring water—all the primitive sensations which they thought they found in the screaming of Buzz Windrip.",
        "Far from the hot-lighted ballrooms where all these crimson-tuniced bandmasters shrillsquabbled as to which should lead for the moment the tremendous spiritual jazz, far off in the cool hills a little man named Doremus Jessup, who wasn't even a bass drummer but only a citizen editor, wondered in confusion what he should do to be saved.",
        "He wanted to follow Roosevelt and the Jeffersonian Party—partly for admiration of the man; partly for the pleasure of shocking the ingrown Republicanism of Vermont.",
        "But he could not believe that the Jeffersonians would have a chance; he did believe that, for all the mothball odor of many of his associates, Walt Trowbridge was a valiant and competent man; and night and day Doremus bounced up and down Beulah Valley campaigning for Trowbridge.",

        "For once he was not amused and tolerant.",
        "Though he never said anything worse of the Jeffersonian Party than that it was ahead of its times, in both editorials and news stories he went after Buzz Windrip and his gang with whips, turpentine, and scandal.",
        "In person, he was into and out of shops and houses all morning long, arguing with voters, getting miniature interviews.",
        "He had expected that traditionally Republican Vermont would give him too drearily easy a task in preaching Trowbridge.",
        "What he found was a dismaying preference for the theoretically Democratic Buzz Windrip.",
        "And that preference, Doremus perceived, wasn't even a pathetic trust in Windrip's promises of Utopian bliss for everyone in general.",
        "It was a trust in increased cash for the voter himself, and for his family, very much in particular.",
        "Most of them had, among all the factors in the campaign, noticed only what they regarded as Windrip's humor, and three planks in his platform: Five, which promised to increase taxes on the rich; Ten, which condemned the Negroes—since nothing so elevates a dispossessed farmer or a factory worker on relief as to have some race, any race, on which he can look down; and, especially, Eleven, which announced, or seemed to announce, that the average toiler would immediately receive $5000 a year.",

        "Yet even knowing all this equipment for a political career, an equipment not much short of Buzz Windrip's, Doremus was surprised to find Shad soap-boxing for Windrip among the quarry-workers, then actually as chairman of a rally in Oddfellows' Hall.",
        "Shad spoke little, but with brutal taunting of the believers in Trowbridge and Roosevelt.",
        "At meetings where he did not speak, Shad was an incomparable bouncer, and in that valued capacity he was summoned to Windrip rallies as far away as Burlington.",
        "It was he who, in a militia uniform, handsomely riding a large white plow-horse, led the final Windrip parade in Rutland...",
        "and substantial men of affairs, even dry-goods jobbers, fondly called him \"Shad.\"\r\n\r\nDoremus was amazed, felt a little apologetic over his failure to have appreciated this new-found paragon, as he sat in American Legion Hall and heard Shad bellowing: \"I don't pretend to be anything but a plain working-stiff, but there's forty million workers like me, and we know that Senator Windrip is the first statesman in years that thinks of what guys like us need before he thinks one doggone thing about politics.",

        "And as to the mob that, with cruel disinterest, galloped past him, a new and heedless smear of faces every second, the man from Fort Beulah could think only that New York must be holding its county fair in this clammy drizzle, or else that there was a big fire somewhere.",
        "He had sensibly planned to save money by using the subway—the substantial village burgher is so poor in the city of the Babylonian gardens!—and he even remembered that there were still to be found in Manhattan five-cent trolley cars, in which a rustic might divert himself by looking at sailors and poets and shawled women from the steppes of Kazakstan.",
        "To the redcap he had piped with what he conceived to be traveled urbanity, \"Guess 'll take a trolley—jus' few blocks.\" But deafened and dizzied and elbow-jabbed by the crowd, soaked and depressed, he took refuge in a taxi, then wished he hadn't, as he saw the slippery rubber-colored pavement, and as his taxi got wedged among other cars stinking of carbon-monoxide and frenziedly tooting for release from the jam—a huddle of robot sheep bleating their terror with mechanical lungs of a hundred horsepower.",
        "He painfully hesitated before going out again from his small hotel in the West Forties, and when he did, when he muddily crept among the shrill shopgirls, the weary chorus girls, the hard cigar-clamping gamblers, and the pretty young men on Broadway, he felt himself, with the rubbers and umbrella which Emma had forced upon him, a very Caspar Milquetoast.",
        "He most noticed a number of stray imitation soldiers, without side-arms or rifles, but in a uniform like that of an American cavalryman in 1870: slant-topped blue forage caps, dark blue tunics, light blue trousers, with yellow stripes at the seam, tucked into leggings of black rubberoid for what appeared to be the privates, and boots of sleek black leather for officers.",
        "Each of them had on the right side of his collar the letters \"M.M.\" and on the left, a five-pointed star.",
        "There were so many of them; they swaggered so brazenly, shouldering civilians out of the way; and upon insignificances like Doremus they looked with frigid insolence.",
        "He suddenly understood.",
        "These young condottieri were the \"Minute Men\": the private troops of Berzelius Windrip, about which Doremus had been publishing uneasy news reports.",
        "He was thrilled and a little dismayed to see them now—the printed words made brutal flesh.",
        "Three weeks ago Windrip had announced that Colonel Dewey Haik had founded, just for the campaign, a nationwide league of Windrip marching-clubs, to be called the Minute Men.",
        "It was probable that they had been in formation for months, since already they had three or four hundred thousand members.",
        "Doremus was afraid the M.M.'s might become a permanent organization, more menacing than the Kuklux Klan.",
        "Their uniform suggested the pioneer America of Cold Harbor and of the Indian fighters under Miles and Custer.",
        "Their emblem, their swastika (here Doremus saw the cunning and mysticism of Lee Sarason), was a five-pointed star, because the star on the American flag was five-pointed, whereas the stars of both the Soviet banner and the Jews—the seal of Solomon—were six-pointed.",
        "The fact that the Soviet star, actually, was also five-pointed, no one noticed, during these excited days of regeneration.",
        "Anyway, it was a nice idea to have this star simultaneously challenge the Jews and the Bolsheviks—the M.M.'s had good intentions, even if their symbolism did slip a little.",
        "Yet the craftiest thing about the M.M.'s was that they wore no colored shirts, but only plain white when on parade, and light khaki when on outpost duty, so that Buzz Windrip could thunder, and frequently, \"Black shirts?",
        "Brown shirts?",
        "Red shirts?",
        "Yes, and maybe cow-brindle shirts!",
        "All these degenerate European uniforms of tyranny!",
        "No sir!",
        "The Minute Men are not Fascist or Communist or anything at all but plain Democratic—the knight-champions of the rights of the Forgotten Men—the shock troops of Freedom!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDoremus dined on Chinese food, his invariable self-indulgence when he was in a large city without Emma, who stated that chow mein was nothing but fried excelsior with flour-paste gravy.",
        "He forgot the leering M.M.",
        "troopers a little; he was happy in glancing at the gilded wood-carvings, at the octagonal lanterns painted with doll-like Chinese peasants crossing arched bridges, at a quartette of guests, two male and two female, who looked like Public Enemies and who all through dinner quarreled with restrained viciousness.",
        "When he headed toward Madison Square Garden and the culminating Windrip rally, he was plunged into a maelstrom.",
        "A whole nation seemed querulously to be headed the same way.",
        "He could not get a taxicab, and walking through the dreary storm some fourteen blocks to Madison Square Garden he was aware of the murderous temper of the crowd.",
        "Eighth Avenue, lined with cheapjack shops, was packed with drab, discouraged people who yet, tonight, were tipsy with the hashish of hope.",
        "They filled the sidewalks, nearly filled the pavement, while irritable motors squeezed tediously through them, and angry policemen were pushed and whirled about and, if they tried to be haughty, got jeered at by lively shopgirls.",
        "Through the welter, before Doremus's eyes, jabbed a flying wedge of Minute Men, led by what he was later to recognize as a cornet of M.M.'s.",
        "They were not on duty, and they were not belligerent; they were cheering, and singing \"Berzelius Windrip went to Wash.,\" reminding Doremus of a slightly drunken knot of students from an inferior college after a football victory.",
        "He was to remember them so afterward, months afterward, when the enemies of the M.M.'s all through the country derisively called them \"Mickey Mouses\" and \"Minnies.\"\r\n\r\nAn old man, shabbily neat, stood blocking them and yelled, \"To hell with Buzz!",
        "Three cheers for F.D.R.!\"\r\n\r\nThe M.M.'s burst into hoodlum wrath.",
        "The cornet in command, a bruiser uglier even than Shad Ledue, hit the old man on the jaw, and he sloped down, sickeningly.",
        "Then, from nowhere, facing the cornet, there was a chief petty officer of the navy, big, smiling, reckless.",
        "The C.P.O.",
        "bellowed, in a voice tuned to hurricanes, \"Swell bunch o' tin soldiers!",
        "Nine o' yuh to one grandpappy!",
        "Just about even—\"\r\n\r\nThe cornet socked him; he laid out the cornet with one foul to the belly; instantly the other eight M.M.'s were on the C.P.O., like sparrows after a hawk, and he crashed, his face, suddenly veal-white, laced with rivulets of blood.",
        "The eight kicked him in the head with their thick marching-shoes.",
        "They were still kicking him when Doremus wriggled away, very sick, altogether helpless.",
        "He had not turned away quickly enough to avoid seeing an M.M.",
        "trooper, girlish-faced, crimson-lipped, fawn-eyed, throw himself on the fallen cornet and, whimpering, stroke that roustabout's roast-beef cheeks with shy gardenia-petal fingers.",
        "There were many arguments, a few private fist fights, and one more battle, before Doremus reached the auditorium.",
        "A block from it some thirty M.M.'s, headed by a battalion-leader— something between a captain and a major—started raiding a street meeting of Communists.",
        "A Jewish girl in khaki, her bare head soaked with rain, was beseeching from the elevation of a wheelbarrow, \"Fellow travelers!",
        "Don't just chew the rag and 'sympathize'!",
        "Join us!",
        "Now!",
        "It's life and death!\" Twenty feet from the Communists, a middle-aged man who looked like a social worker was explaining the Jeffersonian Party, recalling the record of President Roosevelt, and reviling the Communists next door as word-drunk un-American cranks.",
        "Half his audience were people who might be competent voters; half of them—like half of any group on this evening of tragic fiesta—were cigarette-sniping boys in hand-me-downs.",
        "The thirty M.M.'s cheerfully smashed into the Communists.",
        "The battalion leader reached up, slapped the girl speaker, dragged her down from the wheelbarrow.",
        "His followers casually waded in with fists and blackjacks.",
        "Doremus, more nauseated, feeling more helpless than ever, heard the smack of a blackjack on the temple of a scrawny Jewish intellectual.",
        "Amazingly, then, the voice of the rival Jeffersonian leader spiraled up into a scream: \"Come on, you!",
        "Going to let those hellhounds attack our Communist friends—friends now, by God!\" With which the mild bookworm leaped into the air, came down squarely upon a fat Mickey Mouse, capsized him, seized his blackjack, took time to kick another M.M.'s shins before arising from the wreck, sprang up, and waded into the raiders as, Doremus guessed, he would have waded into a table of statistics on the proportion of butter fat in loose milk in 97.7 per cent of shops on Avenue B.",
        "Till then, only half-a-dozen Communist Party members had been facing the M.M.'s, their backs to a garage wall.",
        "Fifty of their own, fifty Jeffersonians besides, now joined them, and with bricks and umbrellas and deadly volumes of sociology they drove off the enraged M.M.'s—partisans of Bela Kun side by side with the partisans of Professor John Dewey—until a riot squad of policemen battered their way in to protect the M.M.'s by arresting the girl Communist speaker and the Jeffersonian.",
        "Doremus had often \"headed up\" sports stories about \"Madison Square Garden Prize Fights,\" but he did know that the place had nothing to do with Madison Square, from which it was a day's journey by bus, that it was decidedly not a garden, that the fighters there did not fight for \"prizes\" but for fixed partnership shares in the business, and that a good many of them did not fight at all.",
        "The mammoth building, as in exhaustion Doremus crawled up to it, was entirely ringed with M.M.'s, elbow to elbow, all carrying heavy canes, and at every entrance, along every aisle, the M.M.'s were rigidly in line, with their officers galloping about, whispering orders, and bearing uneasy rumors like scared calves in a dipping-pen.",
        "These past weeks hungry miners, dispossessed farmers, Carolina mill hands had greeted Senator Windrip with a flutter of worn hands beneath gasoline torches.",
        "Now he was to face, not the unemployed, for they could not afford fifty-cent tickets, but the small, scared side-street traders of New York, who considered themselves altogether superior to clodhoppers and mine-creepers, yet were as desperate as they.",
        "The swelling mass that Doremus saw, proud in seats or standing chin-to-nape in the aisles, in a reek of dampened clothes, was not romantic; they were people concerned with the tailor's goose, the tray of potato salad, the card of hooks-and-eyes, the leech-like mortgage on the owner-driven taxi, with, at home, the baby's diapers, the dull safety-razor blade, the awful rise in the cost of rump steak and kosher chicken.",
        "And a few, and very proud, civil-service clerks and letter carriers and superintendents of small apartment houses, curiously fashionable in seventeen-dollar ready-made suits and feebly stitched foulard ties, who boasted, \"I don't know why all these bums go on relief.",
        "I may not be such a wiz, but let me tell you, even since 1929, I've never made less than two thousand dollars a year!\"\r\n\r\nManhattan peasants.",
        "Kind people, industrious people, generous to their aged, eager to find any desperate cure for the sickness of worry over losing the job.",
        "Most facile material for any rabble-rouser.",
        "The historic rally opened with extreme dullness.",
        "A regimental band played the Tales from Hoffman barcarole with no apparent significance and not much more liveliness.",
        "The Reverend Dr.",
        "Hendrik Van Lollop of St.",
        "Apologue's Lutheran Church offered prayer, but one felt that probably it had not been accepted.",
        "Senator Porkwood provided a dissertation on Senator Windrip which was composed in equal parts of apostolic adoration of Buzz and of the uh-uh-uh's with which Hon.",
        "Porkwood always interspersed his words.",
        "And Windrip wasn't yet even in sight.",
        "Colonel Dewey Haik, nominator of Buzz at the Cleveland convention, was considerably better.",
        "He told three jokes, and an anecdote about a faithful carrier pigeon in the Great War which had seemed to understand, really better than many of the human soldiers, just why it was that the Americans were over there fighting for France against Germany.",
        "The connection of this ornithological hero with the virtues of Senator Windrip did not seem evident, but, after having sat under Senator Porkwood, the audience enjoyed the note of military gallantry.",
        "Doremus felt that Colonel Haik was not merely rambling but pounding on toward something definite.",
        "His voice became more insistent.",
        "He began to talk about Windrip: \"my friend—the one man who dares beard the monetary lion—the man who in his great and simple heart cherishes the woe of every common man as once did the brooding tenderness of Abraham Lincoln.\" Then, wildly waving toward a side entrance, he shrieked, \"And here he comes!",
        "My friends—Buzz Windrip!\"\r\n\r\nThe band hammered out \"The Campbells Are Coming.\" A squadron of Minute Men, smart as Horse Guards, carrying long lances with starred pennants, clicked into the gigantic bowl of the auditorium, and after them, shabby in an old blue-serge suit, nervously twisting a sweat-stained slouch hat, stooped and tired, limped Berzelius Windrip.",
        "The audience leaped up, thrusting one another aside to have a look at the deliverer, cheering like artillery at dawn.",
        "Windrip started prosaically enough.",
        "You felt rather sorry for him, so awkwardly did he lumber up the steps to the platform, across to the center of the stage.",
        "He stopped; stared owlishly.",
        "Then he quacked monotonously:\r\n\r\n\"The first time I ever came to New York I was a greenhorn—no, don't laugh, mebbe I still am!",
        "But I had already been elected a United States Senator, and back home, the way they'd serenaded me, I thought I was some punkins.",
        "I thought my name was just about as familiar to everybody as Al Capone's or Camel Cigarettes or Castoria—Babies Cry For It.",
        "But I come to New York on my way to Washington, and say, I sat in my hotel lobby here for three days, and the only fellow ever spoke to me was the hotel detective!",
        "And when he did come up and address me, I was tickled to death—I thought he was going to tell me the whole burg was pleased by my condescending to visit 'em.",
        "But all he wanted to know was, was I a guest of the hotel and did I have any right to be holding down a lobby chair permanently that way!",
        "And tonight, friends, I'm pretty near as scared of Old Gotham as I was then!\"\r\n\r\nThe laughter, the hand-clapping, were fair enough, but the proud electors were disappointed by his drawl, his weary humility.",
        "Doremus quivered hopefully, \"Maybe he isn't going to get elected!\"\r\n\r\nWindrip outlined his too-familiar platform—Doremus was interested only in observing that Windrip misquoted his own figures regarding the limitation of fortunes, in Point Five.",
        "He slid into a rhapsody of general ideas—a mishmash of polite regards to Justice, Freedom, Equality, Order, Prosperity, Patriotism, and any number of other noble but slippery abstractions.",
        "Doremus thought he was being bored, until he discovered that, at some moment which he had not noticed, he had become absorbed and excited.",
        "Something in the intensity with which Windrip looked at his audience, looked at all of them, his glance slowly taking them in from the highest-perched seat to the nearest, convinced them that he was talking to each individual, directly and solely; that he wanted to take each of them into his heart; that he was telling them the truths, the imperious and dangerous facts, that had been hidden from them.",
        "\"They say I want money—power!",
        "Say, I've turned down offers from law firms right here in New York of three times the money I'll get as President!",
        "And power—why, the President is the servant of every citizen in the country, and not just of the considerate folks, but also of every crank that comes pestering him by telegram and phone and letter.",
        "And yet, it's true, it's absolutely true I do want power, great, big, imperial power—but not for myself—no— for you!—the power of your permission to smash the Jew financiers who've enslaved you, who're working you to death to pay the interest on their bonds; the grasping bankers—and not all of 'em Jews by a darn sight!—the crooked labor-leaders just as much as the crooked bosses, and, most of all, the sneaking spies of Moscow that want you to lick the boots of their self-appointed tyrants that rule not by love and loyalty, like I want to, but by the horrible power of the whip, the dark cell, the automatic pistol!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe pictured, then, a Paradise of democracy in which, with the old political machines destroyed, every humblest worker would be king and ruler, dominating representatives elected from among his own kind of people, and these representatives not growing indifferent, as hitherto they had done, once they were far off in Washington, but kept alert to the public interest by the supervision of a strengthened Executive.",
        "It sounded almost reasonable, for a while.",
        "The supreme actor, Buzz Windrip, was passionate yet never grotesquely wild.",
        "He did not gesture too extravagantly; only, like Gene Debs of old, he reached out a bony forefinger which seemed to jab into each of them and hook out each heart.",
        "It was his mad eyes, big staring tragic eyes, that startled them, and his voice, now thundering, now humbly pleading, that soothed them.",
        "He was so obviously an honest and merciful leader; a man of sorrows and acquaint with woe.",
        "Doremus marveled, \"I'll be hanged!",
        "Why, he's a darn good sort when you come to meet him!",
        "And warm-hearted.",
        "He makes me feel as if I'd been having a good evening with Buck and Steve Perefixe.",
        "What if Buzz is right?",
        "What if—in spite of all the demagogic pap that, I suppose, he has got to feed out to the boobs—he's right in claiming that it's only he, and not Trowbridge or Roosevelt, that can break the hold of the absentee owners?",
        "And these Minute Men, his followers—oh, they were pretty nasty, what I saw out on the street, but still, most of 'em are mighty nice, clean-cut young fellows.",
        "Seeing Buzz and then listening to what he actually says does kind of surprise you—kind of make you think!\"\r\n\r\nBut what Mr.",
        "Windrip actually had said, Doremus could not remember an hour later, when he had come out of the trance.",
        "He was so convinced then that Windrip would win that, on Tuesday evening, he did not remain at the Informer office until the returns were all in.",
        "But if he did not stay for the evidences of the election, they came to him.",
        "Past his house, after midnight, through muddy snow tramped a triumphant and reasonably drunken parade, carrying torches and bellowing to the air of \"Yankee Doodle\" new words revealed just that week by Mrs.",
        "Adelaide Tarr Gimmitch:\r\n\r\n\"The snakes disloyal to our Buzz\r\nWe're riding on a rail,\r\nThey'll wish to God they never was,\r\nWhen we get them in jail!",
        "Chorus:\r\n\r\n\"Buzz and buzz and keep it up\r\nTo victory he's floated.",
        "You were a most ungrateful pup,\r\nUnless for Buzz you voted.",
        "\"Every M.M.",

        "Gimmitch but more probably invented by Dr.",
        "Hector Macgoblin, was to be extensively used by lady patriots as a term expressing such vicious disloyalty to the State as might call for the firing squad.",
        "Yet, like Mrs.",
        "Gimmitch's splendid synthesis \"Unkies,\" for soldiers of the A.E.F., it never really caught on.",
        "Among the winter-coated paraders Doremus and Sissy thought they could make out Shad Ledue, Aras Dilley, that philoprogenitive squatter from Mount Terror, Charley Betts, the furniture dealer, and Tony Mogliani, the fruit-seller, most ardent expounder of Italian Fascism in central Vermont.",
        "And, though he could not be sure of it in the dimness behind the torches, Doremus rather thought that the lone large motorcar following the procession was that of his neighbor, Francis Tasbrough.",
        "Next morning, at the Informer office, Doremus did not learn of so very much damage wrought by the triumphant Nordics—they had merely upset a couple of privies, torn down and burned the tailor-shop sign of Louis Rotenstern, and somewhat badly beaten Clifford Little, the jeweler, a slight, curly-headed young man whom Shad Ledue despised because he organized theatricals and played the organ in Mr.",
        "Falck's church.",
        "That night Doremus found, on his front porch, a notice in red chalk upon butcher's paper:\r\n\r\nYou will get yrs Dorey sweethart unles you get rite down on yr belly and crawl in front of the MM and the League and the Chief and I\r\n\r\nA friend\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that Doremus had heard of \"the Chief,\" a sound American variant of \"the Leader\" or \"the Head of the Government,\" as a popular title for Mr.",
        "Windrip.",
        "It was soon to be made official.",
        "Doremus burned the red warning without telling his family.",

        "CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nAND when I get ready to retire I'm going to build me an up-to-date bungalow in some lovely resort, not in Como or any other of the proverbial Grecian isles you may be sure, but in somewheres like Florida, California, Santa Fe, & etc., and devote myself just to reading the classics, like Longfellow, James Whitcomb Riley, Lord Macaulay, Henry Van Dyke, Elbert Hubbard, Plato, Hiawatha, & etc.",
        "Some of my friends laugh at me for it, but I have always cultivated a taste for the finest in literature.",
        "I got it from my Mother as I did everything that some people have been so good as to admire in me.",
        "Zero Hour, Berzelius Windrip.",

        "All these years I've worked—and I never did want to be on all these committees and boards and charity drives!—and don't they look silly now!",
        "What I always wanted to do was to sneak off to an ivory tower—or anyway, celluloid, imitation ivory—and read everything I've been too busy to read.\"\r\n\r\nThus Doremus, in late November.",
        "And he did actually attempt it, and for a few days reveled in it, avoiding everyone save his family and Lorinda, Buck Titus, and Father Perefixe.",
        "Mostly, though, he found that he did not relish the \"classics\" he had so far missed, but those familiar to his youth: Ivanhoe, Huckleberry Finn, Midsummer Night's Dream, The Tempest, L'Allegro, The Way of All Flesh (not quite so youthful, there), Moby Dick, The Earthly Paradise, St.",
        "Agnes' Eve, The Idylls of the King, most of Swinburne, Pride and Prejudice, Religio Medici, Vanity Fair.",
        "Probably he was not so very different from President-Elect Windrip in his rather uncritical reverence toward any book he had heard of before he was thirty....",
        "No American whose fathers have lived in the country for over two generations is so utterly different from any other American.",
        "In one thing, Doremus's literary escapism failed him thoroughly.",
        "He tried to relearn Latin, but he could not now, uncajoled by a master, believe that \"Mensa, mensae, mensae, mensam, mensa\"—all that idiotic A table, of a table, to a table, toward a table, at in by or on a table—could bear him again as once it had to the honey-sweet tranquillity of Vergil and the Sabine Farm.",
        "Then he saw that in everything his quest failed him.",
        "The reading was good enough, toothsome, satisfying, except that he felt guilty at having sneaked away to an Ivory Tower at all.",
        "Too many years he had made a habit of social duty.",
        "He wanted to be \"in\" things, and he was daily more irritable as Windrip began, even before his inauguration, to dictate to the country.",
        "Buzz's party, with the desertions to the Jeffersonians, had less than a majority in Congress.",
        "\"Inside dope\" came to Doremus from Washington that Windrip was trying to buy, to flatter, to blackmail opposing Congressmen.",
        "A President-Elect has unhallowed power, if he so wishes, and Windrip—no doubt with promises of abnormal favors in the way of patronage—won over a few.",
        "Five Jeffersonian Congressmen had their elections challenged.",
        "One sensationally disappeared, and smoking after his galloping heels there was a devilish fume of embezzlements.",
        "And with each such triumph of Windrip, all the well-meaning, cloistered Doremuses of the country were the more anxious.",
        "All through the \"Depression,\" ever since 1929, Doremus had felt the insecurity, the confusion, the sense of futility in trying to do anything more permanent than shaving or eating breakfast, that was general to the country.",
        "He could no longer plan, for himself or for his dependants, as the citizens of this once unsettled country had planned since 1620.",
        "Why, their whole lives had been predicated on the privilege of planning.",
        "Depressions had been only cyclic storms, certain to end in sunshine; Capitalism and parliamentary government were eternal, and eternally being improved by the honest votes of Good Citizens.",
        "Doremus's grandfather, Calvin, Civil War veteran and ill-paid, illiberal Congregational minister, had yet planned, \"My son, Loren, shall have a theological education, and I think we shall be able to build a fine new house in fifteen or twenty years.\" That had given him a reason for working, and a goal.",
        "His father, Loren, had vowed, \"Even if I have to economize on books a little, and perhaps give up this extravagance of eating meat four times a week—very bad for the digestion, anyway—my son, Doremus, shall have a college education, and when, as he desires, he becomes a publicist, I think perhaps I shall be able to help him for a year or two.",
        "And then I hope—oh, in a mere five or six years more—to buy that complete Dickens with all the illustrations—oh, an extravagance, but a thing to leave to my grandchildren to treasure forever!\"\r\n\r\nBut Doremus Jessup could not plan, \"I'll have Sissy go to Smith before she studies architecture,\" or \"If Julian Falck and Sissy get married and stick here in the Fort, I'll give 'em the southwest lot and some day, maybe fifteen years from now, the whole place will be filled with nice kids again!\" No.",
        "Fifteen years from now, he sighed, Sissy might be hustling hash for the sort of workers who called the waiter's art \"hustling hash\"; and Julian might be in a concentration camp—Fascist or Communist!",
        "The Horatio Alger tradition, from rags to Rockefellers, was clean gone out of the America it had dominated.",
        "It seemed faintly silly to hope, to try to prophesy, to give up sleep on a good mattress for toil on a typewriter, and as for saving money—idiotic!",
        "And for a newspaper editor—for one who must know, at least as well as the Encyclopaedia, everything about local and foreign history, geography, economics, politics, literature, and methods of playing football—it was maddening that it seemed impossible now to know anything surely.",
        "\"He don't know what it's all about\" had in a year or two changed from a colloquial sneer to a sound general statement regarding almost any economist.",
        "Once, modestly enough, Doremus had assumed that he had a decent knowledge of finance, taxation, the gold standard, agricultural exports, and he had smilingly pontificated everywhere that Liberal Capitalism would pastorally lead into State Socialism, with governmental ownership of mines and railroads and water-power so settling all inequalities of income that every lion of a structural steel worker would be willing to lie down with any lamb of a contractor, and all the jails and tuberculosis sanatoria would be clean empty.",
        "Now he knew that he knew nothing fundamental and, like a lone monk stricken with a conviction of sin, he mourned, \"If I only knew more!...",
        "Yes, and if I could only remember statistics!\"\r\n\r\nThe coming and the going of the N.R.A., the F.E.R.A., the P.W.A., and all the rest, had convinced Doremus that there were four sets of people who did not clearly understand anything whatever about how the government must be conducted: all the authorities in Washington; all of the citizenry who talked or wrote profusely about politics; the bewildered untouchables who said nothing; and Doremus Jessup.",
        "\"But,\" said he, \"now, after Buzz's inauguration, everything is going to be completely simple and comprehensible again—the country is going to be run as his private domain!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJulian Falck, now sophomore in Amherst, had come home for Christmas vacation, and he dropped in at the Informer office to beg from Doremus a ride home before dinner.",
        "He called Doremus \"sir\" and did not seem to think he was a comic fossil.",
        "Doremus liked it.",
        "On the way they stopped for gasoline at the garage of John Pollikop, the seething Social Democrat, and were waited upon by Karl Pascal—sometime donkey-engine-man at Tasbrough's quarry, sometime strike leader, sometime political prisoner in the county jail on a thin charge of inciting to riot, and ever since then, a model of Communistic piety.",
        "Pascal was a thin man, but sinewy; his gaunt and humorous face of a good mechanic was so grease-darkened that the skin above and below his eyes seemed white as a fish-belly, and, in turn, that pallid rim made his eyes, alert dark gipsy eyes, seem the larger....",
        "A panther chained to a coal cart.",
        "\"Well, what you going to do after this election?\" said Doremus.",
        "\"Oh!",
        "That's a fool question!",
        "I guess none of us chronic kickers want to say much about what we plan to do after January, when Buzz gets his hands on us.",
        "Lie low, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to lie the lowest lie that I ever did.",
        "You bet!",
        "But maybe there'll be a few Communist cells around here now, when Fascism begins to get into people's hair.",
        "Never did have much success with my propaganda before, but now, you watch!\" exulted Pascal.",
        "\"You don't seem so depressed by the election,\" marveled Doremus, while Julian offered, \"No—you seem quite cheerful about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Depressed?",
        "Why good Lord, Mr.",
        "Jessup, I thought you knew your revolutionary tactics better than that, way you supported us in the quarry strike—even if you are the perfect type of small capitalist bourgeois!",
        "Depressed?",
        "Why, can't you see, if the Communists had paid for it they couldn't have had anything more elegant for our purposes than the election of a pro-plutocrat, itching militarist dictator like Buzz Windrip!",
        "Look!",
        "He'll get everybody plenty dissatisfied.",
        "But they can't do anything, barehanded against the armed troops.",
        "Then he'll whoop it up for a war, and so millions of people will have arms and food rations in their hands—all ready for the revolution!",
        "Hurray for Buzz and John Prang the Baptist!\"\r\n\r\n\"Karl, it's funny about you.",
        "I honestly believe you believe in Communism!\" marveled young Julian.",
        "\"Don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go and ask your friend Father Perefixe if he believes in the Virgin?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you seem to like America, and you don't seem so fanatical, Karl.",
        "I remember when I was a kid of about ten and you—I suppose you were about twenty-five or -six then—you used to slide with us and whoop like hell, and you made me a ski-stick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I like America.",
        "Came here when I was two years old—I was born in Germany—my folks weren't Heinies, though—my dad was French and my mother a Hunkie from Serbia.",
        "(Guess that makes me a hundred per cent American, all right!) I think we've got the Old Country beat, lots of ways.",
        "Why, say, Julian, over there I'd have to call you 'Mein Herr' or 'Your Excellency,' or some fool thing, and you'd call me, 'I say-uh, Pascal!' and Mr.",
        "Jessup here, my Lord, he'd be 'Commendatore' or 'Herr Doktor'!",
        "No, I like it here.",
        "There's symptoms of possible future democracy.",
        "But—but—what burns me up—it isn't that old soap-boxer's chestnut about how one tenth of 1 per cent of the population at the top have an aggregate income equal to 42 per cent at the bottom.",
        "Figures like that are too astronomical.",
        "Don't mean a thing in the world to a fellow with his eyes—and nose—down in a transmission box—fellow that doesn't see the stars except after 9 P.M.",
        "on odd Wednesdays.",
        "But what burns me up is the fact that even before this Depression, in what you folks called prosperous times, 7 per cent of all the families in the country earned $500 a year or less—remember, those weren't the unemployed, on relief; those were the guys that had the honor of still doing honest labor.",
        "\"Five hundred dollars a year is ten dollars a week—and that means one dirty little room for a family of four people!",
        "It means $5.00 a week for all their food—eighteen cents per day per person for food!—and even the lousiest prisons allow more than that.",
        "And the magnificent remainder of $2.50 a week, that means nine cents per day per person for clothes, insurance, carfares, doctors' bills, dentists' bills, and for God's sake, amusements—amusements!—and all the rest of the nine cents a day they can fritter away on their Fords and autogiros and, when they feel fagged, skipping across the pond on the Normandie!",
        "Seven per cent of all the fortunate American families where the old man has got a job!\"\r\n\r\nJulian was silent; then whispered, \"You know—fellow gets discussing economics in college—theoretically sympathetic—but to see your own kids living on eighteen cents a day for grub—I guess that would make a man pretty extremist!\"\r\n\r\nDoremus fretted, \"But what percentage of forced labor in your Russian lumber camps and Siberian prison mines are getting more than that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haaa!",
        "That's all baloney!",
        "That's the old standard come-back at every Communist—just like once, twenty years ago, the muttonheads used to think they'd crushed any Socialist when they snickered 'If all the money was divided up, inside five years the hustlers would have all of it again.' Prob'ly there's some standard coup de grace like that in Russia, to crush anybody that defends America.",
        "Besides!\" Karl Pascal glowed with nationalistic fervor.",
        "\"We Americans aren't like those dumb Russki peasants!",
        "We'll do a whole lot better when WE get Communism!\"\r\n\r\nAnd on that, his employer, the expansive John Pollikop, a woolly Scotch terrier of a man, returned to the garage.",
        "John was an excellent friend of Doremus; had, indeed, been his bootlegger all through Prohibition, personally running in his whisky from Canada.",
        "He had been known, even in that singularly scrupulous profession, as one of its most trustworthy practitioners.",
        "Now he flowered into mid-European dialectics:\r\n\r\n\"Evenin', Mist' Jessup, evenin', Julian!",
        "Karl fill up y' tank for you?",
        "You want t' watch that guy—he's likely to hold out a gallon on you.",
        "He's one of these crazy dogs of Communists—they all believe in Violence instead of Evolution and Legality.",
        "Them—why say, if they hadn't been so crooked, if they'd joined me and Norman Thomas and the other INTELLIGENT Socialists in a United Front with Roosevelt and the Jeffersonians, why say, we'd of licked the pants off Buzzard Windrip!",
        "Windrip and his plans!\"\r\n\r\n(\"Buzzard\" Windrip.",
        "That was good, Doremus reflected.",
        "He'd be able to use it in the Informer!)\r\n\r\nPascal protested, \"Not that Buzzard's personal plans and ambitions have got much to do with it.",
        "Altogether too easy to explain everything just blaming it on Windrip.",
        "Why don't you READ your Marx, John, instead of always gassing about him?",
        "Why, Windrip's just something nasty that's been vomited up.",
        "Plenty others still left fermenting in the stomach—quack economists with every sort of economic ptomain!",
        "No, Buzz isn't important—it's the sickness that made us throw him up that we've got to attend to—the sickness of more than 30 per cent permanently unemployed, and growing larger.",
        "Got to cure it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you crazy Tovarishes cure it?\" snapped Pollikop, and, \"Do you think Communism will cure it?\" skeptically wondered Doremus, and, more politely, \"Do you really think Karl Marx had the dope?\" worried Julian, all three at once.",
        "\"You bet your life we can!\" said Pascal vaingloriously.",
        "As Doremus, driving away, looked back at them, Pascal and Pollikop were removing a flat tire together and quarreling bitterly, quite happily.",
        "Doremus's attic study had been to him a refuge from the tender solicitudes of Emma and Mrs.",
        "Candy and his daughters, and all the impulsive hand-shaking strangers who wanted the local editor to start off their campaigns for the sale of life insurance or gas-saving carburetors, for the Salvation Army or the Red Cross or the Orphans' Home or the Anti-cancer Crusade, or the assorted magazines which would enable to go through college young men who at all cost should be kept out of college.",
        "It was a refuge now from the considerably less tender solicitudes of supporters of the President-Elect.",
        "On the pretense of work, Doremus took to sneaking up there in mid-evening; and he sat not in an easy chair but stiffly, at his desk, making crosses and five-pointed stars and six-pointed stars and fancy delete signs on sheets of yellow copy paper, while he sorely meditated.",
        "Thus, this evening, after the demands of Karl Pascal and John Pollikop:\r\n\r\n\"'The Revolt against Civilization!'\r\n\r\n\"But there's the worst trouble of this whole cursed business of analysis.",
        "When I get to defending Democracy against Communism and Fascism and what-not, I sound just like the Lothrop Stoddards—why, I sound almost like a Hearst editorial on how some college has got to kick out a Dangerous Red instructor in order to preserve our Democracy for the ideals of Jefferson and Washington!",
        "Yet somehow, singing the same words, I have a notion my tune is entirely different from Hearst's.",
        "I DON'T think we've done very well with all the plowland and forest and minerals and husky human stock we've had.",
        "What makes me sick about Hearst and the D.A.R.",
        "is that if THEY are against Communism, I have to be for it, and I don't want to be!",
        "\"Wastage of resources, so they're about gone—that's been the American share in the revolt against Civilization.",
        "\"We can go back to the Dark Ages!",
        "The crust of learning and good manners and tolerance is so thin!",
        "It would just take a few thousand big shells and gas bombs to wipe out all the eager young men, and all the libraries and historical archives and patent offices, all the laboratories and art galleries, all the castles and Periclean temples and Gothic cathedrals, all the cooperative stores and motor factories—every storehouse of learning.",
        "No inherent reason why Sissy's grandchildren—if anybody's grandchildren will survive at all—shouldn't be living in caves and heaving rocks at catamounts.",
        "\"And what's the solution of preventing this debacle?",
        "Plenty of 'em!",
        "The Communists have a patent Solution they know will work.",
        "So have the Fascists, and the rigid American Constitutionalists— who CALL themselves advocates of Democracy, without any notion what the word ought to mean; and the Monarchists—who are certain that if we could just resurrect the Kaiser and the Czar and King Alfonso, everybody would be loyal and happy again, and the banks would simply force credit on small businessmen at 2 per cent.",
        "And all the preachers—they tell you that they alone have the inspired Solution.",
        "\"Well, gentlemen, I have listened to all your Solutions, and I now inform you that I, and I alone, except perhaps for Walt Trowbridge and the ghost of Pareto, have the perfect, the inevitable, the only Solution, and that is: There is no Solution!",
        "There will never be a state of society anything like perfect!",
        "\"There never will be a time when there won't be a large proportion of people who feel poor no matter how much they have, and envy their neighbors who know how to wear cheap clothes showily, and envy neighbors who can dance or make love or digest better.\"\r\n\r\nDoremus suspected that, with the most scientific state, it would be impossible for iron deposits always to find themselves at exactly the rate decided upon two years before by the National Technocratic Minerals Commission, no matter how elevated and fraternal and Utopian the principles of the commissioners.",
        "His Solution, Doremus pointed out, was the only one that did not flee before the thought that a thousand years from now human beings would probably continue to die of cancer and earthquake and such clownish mishaps as slipping in bathtubs.",
        "It presumed that mankind would continue to be burdened with eyes that grow weak, feet that grow tired, noses that itch, intestines vulnerable to bacilli, and generative organs that are nervous until the age of virtue and senility.",
        "It seemed to him unidealistically probable, for all the \"contemporary furniture\" of the 1930's, that most people would continue, at least for a few hundred years, to sit in chairs, eat from dishes upon tables, read books—no matter how many cunning phonographic substitutes might be invented, wear shoes or sandals, sleep in beds, write with some sort of pens, and in general spend twenty or twenty-two hours a day much as they had spent them in 1930, in 1630.",
        "He suspected that tornadoes, floods, droughts, lightning, and mosquitoes would remain, along with the homicidal tendency known in the best of citizens when their sweethearts go dancing off with other men.",
        "And, most fatally and abysmally, his Solution guessed that men of superior cunning, of slyer foxiness, whether they might be called Comrades, Brethren, Commissars, Kings, Patriots, Little Brothers of the Poor, or any other rosy name, would continue to have more influence than slower-witted men, however worthy.",
        "All the warring Solutions—except his, Doremus chuckled—were ferociously propagated by the Fanatics, the \"Nuts.\"\r\n\r\nHe recalled an article in which Neil Carothers asserted that the \"rabble-rousers\" of America in the mid-'thirties had a long and dishonorable ancestry of prophets who had felt called upon to stir up the masses to save the world, and save it in the prophets' own way, and do it right now, and most violently: Peter the Hermit, the ragged, mad, and stinking monk who, to rescue the (unidentified) tomb of the Savior from undefined \"outrages by the pagans,\" led out on the Crusades some hundreds of thousands of European peasants, to die on the way of starvation, after burning, raping, and murdering fellow peasants in foreign villages all along the road.",
        "There was John Ball who \"in 1381 was a share-the-wealth advocate; he preached equality of wealth, the abolition of class distinctions, and what would now be called communism,\" and whose follower, Wat Tyler, looted London, with the final gratifying result that afterward Labor was by the frightened government more oppressed than ever.",
        "And nearly three hundred years later, Cromwell's methods of expounding the sweet winsomeness of Purity and Liberty were shooting, slashing, clubbing, starving, and burning people, and after him the workers paid for the spree of bloody righteousness with blood.",
        "Brooding about it, fishing in the muddy slew of recollection which most Americans have in place of a clear pool of history, Doremus was able to add other names of well-meaning rabble-rousers:\r\n\r\nMurat and Danton and Robespierre, who helped shift the control of France from the moldy aristocrats to the stuffy, centime-pinching shopkeepers.",
        "Lenin and Trotzky who gave to the illiterate Russian peasants the privileges of punching a time clock and of being as learned, gay, and dignified as the factory hands in Detroit; and Lenin's man, Borodin, who extended this boon to China.",
        "And that William Randolph Hearst who in 1898 was the Lenin of Cuba and switched the mastery of the golden isle from the cruel Spaniards to the peaceful, unarmed, brotherly-loving Cuban politicians of today.",
        "The American Moses, Dowie, and his theocracy at Zion City, Illinois, where the only results of the direct leadership of God— as directed and encouraged by Mr.",
        "Dowie and by his even more spirited successor, Mr.",
        "Voliva—were that the holy denizens were deprived of oysters and cigarettes and cursing, and died without the aid of doctors instead of with it, and that the stretch of road through Zion City incessantly caused the breakage of springs on the cars of citizens from Evanston, Wilmette, and Winnetka, which may or not have been a desirable Good Deed.",
        "Cecil Rhodes, his vision of making South Africa a British paradise, and the actuality of making it a graveyard for British soldiers.",
        "All the Utopias—Brook Farm, Robert Owen's sanctuary of chatter, Upton Sinclair's Helicon Hall—and their regulation end in scandal, feuds, poverty, griminess, disillusion.",
        "All the leaders of Prohibition, so certain that their cause was world-regenerating that for it they were willing to shoot down violators.",
        "It seemed to Doremus that the only rabble-rouser to build permanently had been Brigham Young, with his bearded Mormon captains, who not only turned the Utah desert into an Eden but made it pay and kept it up.",
        "Pondered Doremus: Blessed be they who are not Patriots and Idealists, and who do not feel they must dash right in and Do Something About It, something so immediately important that all doubters must be liquidated—tortured—slaughtered!",
        "Good old murder, that since the slaying of Abel by Cain has always been the new device by which all oligarchies and dictators have, for all future ages to come, removed opposition!",
        "In this acid mood Doremus doubted the efficacy of all revolutions; dared even a little to doubt our two American revolutions—against England in 1776, and the Civil War.",
        "For a New England editor to contemplate even the smallest criticism of these wars was what it would have been for a Southern Baptist fundamentalist preacher to question Immortality, the Inspiration of the Bible, and the ethical value of shouting Hallelujah.",
        "Yet had it, Doremus queried nervously, been necessary to have four years of inconceivably murderous Civil War, followed by twenty years of commercial oppression of the South, in order to preserve the Union, free the slaves, and establish the equality of Industry with Agriculture?",
        "Had it been just to the Negroes themselves to throw them so suddenly, with so little preparation, into full citizenship, that the Southern states, in what they considered self-defense, disqualified them at the polls and lynched them and lashed them?",
        "Could they not, as Lincoln at first desired and planned, have been freed without the vote, then gradually and competently educated, under federal guardianship, so that by 1890 they might, without too much enmity, have been able to enter fully into all the activities of the land?",
        "A generation and a half (Doremus meditated) of the sturdiest and most gallant killed or crippled in the Civil War or, perhaps worst of all, becoming garrulous professional heroes and satellites of the politicians who in return for their solid vote made all lazy jobs safe for the G.A.R.",
        "The most valorous, it was they who suffered the most, for while the John D.",
        "Rockefellers, the J.",
        "P.",
        "Morgans, the Vanderbilts, Astors, Goulds, and all their nimble financial comrades of the South, did not enlist, but stayed in the warm, dry counting-house, drawing the fortune of the country into their webs, it was Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Nathaniel Lyon, Pat Cleburne, and the knightly James B.",
        "McPherson who were killed...",
        "and with them Abraham Lincoln.",
        "So, with the hundreds of thousands who should have been the progenitors of new American generations drained away, we could show the world, which from 1780 to 1860 had so admired men like Franklin, Jefferson, Washington, Hamilton, the Adamses, Webster, only such salvages as McKinley, Benjamin Harrison, William Jennings Bryan, Harding...",
        "and Senator Berzelius Windrip and his rivals.",
        "Slavery had been a cancer, and in that day was known no remedy save bloody cutting.",
        "There had been no X-rays of wisdom and tolerance.",
        "Yet to sentimentalize this cutting, to justify and rejoice in it, was an altogether evil thing, a national superstition that was later to lead to other Unavoidable Wars—wars to free Cubans, to free Filipinos who didn't want our brand of freedom, to End All Wars.",
        "Let us, thought Doremus, not throb again to the bugles of the Civil War, nor find diverting the gallantry of Sherman's dashing Yankee boys in burning the houses of lone women, nor particularly admire the calmness of General Lee as he watched thousands writhe in the mud.",
        "He even wondered if, necessarily, it had been such a desirable thing for the Thirteen Colonies to have cut themselves off from Great Britain.",
        "Had the United States remained in the British Empire, possibly there would have evolved a confederation that could have enforced World Peace, instead of talking about it.",
        "Boys and girls from Western ranches and Southern plantations and Northern maple groves might have added Oxford and York Minster and Devonshire villages to their own domain.",
        "Englishmen, and even virtuous Englishwomen, might have learned that persons who lack the accent of a Kentish rectory or of a Yorkshire textile village may yet in many ways be literate; and that astonishing numbers of persons in the world cannot be persuaded that their chief aim in life ought to be to increase British exports on behalf of the stock-holdings of the Better Classes.",
        "It is commonly asserted, Doremus remembered, that without complete political independence the United States could not have developed its own peculiar virtues.",
        "Yet it was not apparent to him that America was any more individual than Canada or Australia; that Pittsburgh and Kansas City were to be preferred before Montreal and Melbourne, Sydney and Vancouver.",
        "No questioning of the eventual wisdom of the \"radicals\" who had first advocated these two American revolutions, Doremus warned himself, should be allowed to give any comfort to that eternal enemy: the conservative manipulators of privilege who damn as \"dangerous agitators\" any man who menaces their fortunes; who jump in their chairs at the sting of a gnat like Debs, and blandly swallow a camel like Windrip.",
        "Between the rabble-rousers—chiefly to be detected by desire for their own personal power and notoriety—and the un-self-seeking fighters against tyranny, between William Walker or Danton, and John Howard or William Lloyd Garrison, Doremus saw, there was the difference between a noisy gang of thieves and an honest man noisily defending himself against thieves.",
        "He had been brought up to revere the Abolitionists: Lovejoy, Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Harriet Beecher Stowe—though his father had considered John Brown insane and a menace, and had thrown sly mud at the marble statues of Henry Ward Beecher, the apostle in the fancy vest.",
        "And Doremus could not do otherwise than revere the Abolitionists now, though he wondered a little if Stephen Douglas and Thaddeus Stephens and Lincoln, more cautious and less romantic men, might not have done the job better.",
        "\"Is it just possible,\" he sighed, \"that the most vigorous and boldest idealists have been the worst enemies of human progress instead of its greatest creators?",
        "Possible that plain men with the humble trait of minding their own business will rank higher in the heavenly hierarchy than all the plumed souls who have shoved their way in among the masses and insisted on saving them?\"\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nI JOINED the Christian, or as some call it, the Campbellite Church as a mere boy, not yet dry behind the ears.",
        "But I wished then and I wish now that it were possible for me to belong to the whole glorious brotherhood; to be one in Communion at the same time with the brave Presbyterians that fight the pusillanimous, mendacious, destructive, tom-fool Higher Critics, so-called; and with the Methodists who so strongly oppose war yet in war-time can always be counted upon for Patriotism to the limit; and with the splendidly tolerant Baptists, the earnest Seventh-Day Adventists, and I guess I could even say a kind word for the Unitarians, as that great executive William Howard Taft belonged to them, also his wife.",
        "Zero Hour, Berzelius Windrip.",
        "OFFICIALLY, Doremus belonged to the Universalist Church, his wife and children to the Episcopal—a natural American transition.",
        "He had been reared to admire Hosea Ballou, the Universalist St.",
        "Augustine who, from his tiny parsonage in Barnard, Vermont, had proclaimed his faith that even the wickedest would have, after earthly death, another chance of salvation.",
        "But now, Doremus could scarce enter the Fort Beulah Universalist Church.",
        "It had too many memories of his father, the pastor, and it was depressing to see how the old-time congregations, in which two hundred thick beards would wag in the grained pine benches every Sunday morning, and their womenfolks and children line up beside the patriarchs, had dwindled to aged widows and farmers and a few schoolteachers.",
        "But in this time of seeking, Doremus did venture there.",
        "The church was a squat and gloomy building of granite, not particularly enlivened by the arches of colored slate above the windows, yet as a boy Doremus had thought it and its sawed-off tower the superior of Chartres.",
        "He had loved it as in Isaiah College he had loved the Library which, for all its appearance of being a crouching red-brick toad, had meant to him freedom for spiritual discovery—still cavern of a reading room where for hours one could forget the world and never be nagged away to supper.",
        "He found, on his one attendance at the Universalist church, a scattering of thirty disciples, being addressed by a \"supply,\" a theological student from Boston, monotonously shouting his well-meant, frightened, and slightly plagiaristic eloquence in regard to the sickness of Abijah, the son of Jeroboam.",
        "Doremus looked at the church walls, painted a hard and glistening green, unornamented, to avoid all the sinful trappings of papistry, while he listened to the preacher's hesitant droning:\r\n\r\n\"Now, uh, now what so many of us fail to realize is how, uh, how sin, how any sin that we, uh, we ourselves may commit, any sin reflects not on ourselves but on those that we, uh, that we hold near and dear—\"\r\n\r\nHe would have given anything, Doremus yearned, for a sermon which, however irrational, would passionately lift him to renewed courage, which would bathe him in consolation these beleagured months.",
        "But with a shock of anger he saw that that was exactly what he had been condemning just a few days ago: the irrational dramatic power of the crusading leader, clerical or political.",
        "Very well then—sadly.",
        "He'd just have to get along without the spiritual consolation of the church that he had known in college days.",
        "No, first he'd try the ritual of his friend Mr.",
        "Falck—the Padre, Buck Titus sometimes called him.",
        "In the cozy Anglicanism of St.",
        "Crispin's P.",
        "E.",
        "Church, with its imitation English memorial brasses and imitation Celtic font and brass-eagle reading desk and dusty-smelling maroon carpet, Doremus listened to Mr.",

        "The lovely, familiar old ritual seemed meaningless to him now, with no more pertinence to a life menaced by Buzz Windrip and his Minute Men, no more comfort for having lost his old deep pride in being an American, than a stage revival of an equally lovely and familiar Elizabethan play.",

        "It wasn't, of course, a tavern: it was a super-boarding-house as regards its twelve guest bedrooms, and a slightly too arty tearoom in its dining facilities.",
        "Despite his long affection for Lorinda, Doremus was always annoyed by the Singhalese brass finger bowls, the North Carolina table mats, and the Italian ash trays displayed for sale on wabbly card tables in the dining room.",
        "But he had to admit that the tea was excellent, the scones light, the Stilton sound, Lorinda's private rum punches admirable, and that Lorinda herself was intelligent yet adorable— particularly when, as on this gray afternoon, she was bothered neither by other guests nor by the presence of that worm, her partner, Mr.",

        "It meant, however, that his hermitage in the Ivory Tower was closed with slightly ludicrous speed.",

        "Any day!",
        "I'm awfully proud—old dish rag like me, twenty years older than you!—to be your lover!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was proud, yet all the while he was remembering the warning in red chalk that he had found on his front porch after the election.",

        "And part hidden behind bushes, leaning on his motorcycle, he did find Shad Ledue.",
        "Shad was startled; for once he looked less contemptuously masterful than a Fifth Avenue traffic policeman, as Doremus snapped, \"What you doing there?\" and he stumbled in answering: \"Oh I just— something happened to my motor-bike.\"\r\n\r\n\"So!",
        "You ought to be home tending the furnace, Shad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess I got my machine fixed now.",

        "Trying to talk to him like a gent!",
        "But how I would enjoy murdering him!\"\r\n\r\nHe informed Sissy, at the door, \"Shad happened to come along— motorcycle in bad shape—let him take my Chrysler—I'll drive with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine!",
        "Only six boys have had their hair turn gray, driving with me, this week.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I—I meant to say, I think I'd better do the driving.",

        "He assured himself, though, that this flip manner of Sissy, characteristic of even the provincial boys and girls who had been nursed on gasoline, was only an imitation of the nicer New York harlots and would not last more than another year or two.",

        "Look at almost any college class—the students disapproving of the instructor because he's iconoclastic and ridicules the sacred home-town ideas.",
        "Just this afternoon, I was thinking, driving out here—\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Dad, do you go to Lindy's often?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why—why, not especially.",

        "Well, maybe.",
        "Unusual to suggest it—aloud.",

        "Skittle had once been indicted on a charge of defrauding the government on his income tax, but he had been acquitted, more or less, and during the campaign, he was said to have taken a convincing way of showing his faith in Buzz Windrip as the Savior of the Forgotten Men.",
        "Secretary of War: Colonel Osceola Luthorne, formerly editor of the Topeka (Kans.) Argus, and the Fancy Goods and Novelties Gazette; more recently high in real estate.",
        "His title came from his position on the honorary staff of the Governor of Tennessee.",
        "He had long been a friend and fellow campaigner of Windrip.",
        "It was a universal regret that Bishop Paul Peter Prang should have refused the appointment as Secretary of War, with a letter in which he called Windrip \"My dear Friend and Collaborator\" and asserted that he had actually meant it when he had said he desired no office.",
        "Later, it was a similar regret when Father Coughlin refused the Ambassadorship to Mexico, with no letter at all but only a telegram cryptically stating, \"Just six months too late.\"\r\n\r\nA new cabinet position, that of Secretary of Education and Public Relations, was created.",
        "Not for months would Congress investigate the legality of such a creation, but meantime the new post was brilliantly held by Hector Macgoblin, M.D., Ph.D., Hon.",
        "Litt.D.",
        "Senator Porkwood graced the position of Attorney General, and all the other offices were acceptably filled by men who, though they had roundly supported Windrip's almost socialistic projects for the distribution of excessive fortunes, were yet known to be thoroughly sensible men, and no fanatics.",
        "It was said, though Doremus Jessup could never prove it, that Windrip learned from Lee Sarason the Spanish custom of getting rid of embarrassing friends and enemies by appointing them to posts abroad, preferably quite far abroad.",
        "Anyway, as Ambassador to Brazil, Windrip appointed Herbert Hoover, who not very enthusiastically accepted; as Ambassador to Germany, Senator Borah; as Governor of the Philippines, Senator Robert La Follette, who refused; and as Ambassadors to the Court of St.",
        "James's, France, and Russia, none other than Upton Sinclair, Milo Reno, and Senator Bilbo of Mississippi.",
        "These three had a fine time.",
        "Mr.",
        "Sinclair pleased the British by taking so friendly an interest in their politics that he openly campaigned for the Independent Labor Party and issued a lively brochure called \"I, Upton Sinclair, Prove That Prime-Minister Walter Elliot, Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, and First Lord of the Admiralty Nancy Astor Are All Liars and Have Refused to Accept My Freely Offered Advice.\" Mr.",
        "Sinclair also aroused considerable interest in British domestic circles by advocating an act of Parliament forbidding the wearing of evening clothes and all hunting of foxes except with shotguns; and on the occasion of his official reception at Buckingham Palace, he warmly invited King George and Queen Mary to come and live in California.",
        "Mr.",
        "Milo Reno, insurance salesman and former president of the National Farm Holiday Association, whom all the French royalists compared to his great predecessor, Benjamin Franklin, for forthrightness, became the greatest social favorite in the international circles of Paris, the Basses-Pyrénées, and the Riviera, and was once photographed playing tennis at Antibes with the Duc de Tropez, Lord Rothermere, and Dr.",

        "Stalin asked his advice, as based on his ripe experience in the Gleichshaltung of Mississippi, about the cultural organization of the somewhat backward natives of Tadjikistan, and so valuable did it prove that Excellency Bilbo was invited to review the Moscow military celebration, the following November seventh, in the same stand with the very highest class of representatives of the classless state.",
        "It was a triumph for His Excellency.",
        "Generalissimo Voroshilov fainted after 200,000 Soviet troops, 7000 tanks, and 9000 aeroplanes had passed by; Stalin had to be carried home after reviewing 317,000; but Ambassador Bilbo was there in the stand when the very last of the 626,000 soldiers had gone by, all of them saluting him under the quite erroneous impression that he was the Chinese Ambassador; and he was still tirelessly returning their salutes, fourteen to the minute, and softly singing with them the \"International.\"\r\n\r\nHe was less of a hit later, however, when to the unsmiling Anglo-American Association of Exiles to Soviet Russia from Imperialism, he sang to the tune of the \"International\" what he regarded as amusing private words of his own:\r\n\r\n\"Arise, ye prisoners of starvation,\r\nFrom Russia make your getaway.",

        "She had demanded that there be created, especially for her, the cabinet position of Secretaryess of Domestic Science, Child Welfare, and Anti-Vice.",
        "She threatened to turn Jeffersonian, Republican, or Communistic, but in April she was heard of in Hollywood, writing the scenario for a giant picture to be called, They Did It in Greece.",

        "Roosevelt minister to Liberia.",
        "Mr.",
        "Roosevelt's opponents laughed very much, and opposition newspapers did cartoons of him sitting unhappily in a grass hut with a sign on which \"N.R.A.\" had been crossed out and \"U.S.A.\" substituted.",
        "But Mr.",
        "Roosevelt declined with so amiable a smile that the joke seemed rather to have slipped.",
        "The followers of President Windrip trumpeted that it was significant that he should be the first president inaugurated not on March fourth, but on January twentieth, according to the provision of the new Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution.",
        "It was a sign straight from Heaven (though, actually, Heaven had not been the author of the amendment, but Senator George W.",
        "Norris of Nebraska), and proved that Windrip was starting a new paradise on earth.",
        "The inauguration was turbulent.",
        "President Roosevelt declined to be present—he politely suggested that he was about half ill unto death, but that same noon he was seen in a New York shop, buying books on gardening and looking abnormally cheerful.",
        "More than a thousand reporters, photographers, and radio men covered the inauguration.",
        "Twenty-seven constituents of Senator Porkwood, of all sexes, had to sleep on the floor of the Senator's office, and a hall-bedroom in the suburb of Bladensburg rented for thirty dollars for two nights.",
        "The presidents of Brazil, the Argentine, and Chile flew to the inauguration in a Pan-American aeroplane, and Japan sent seven hundred students on a special train from Seattle.",
        "A motor company in Detroit had presented to Windrip a limousine with armor plate, bulletproof glass, a hidden nickel-steel safe for papers, a concealed private bar, and upholstery made from the Troissant tapestries of 1670.",
        "But Buzz chose to drive from his home to the Capitol in his old Hupmobile sedan, and his driver was a youngster from his home town whose notion of a uniform for state occasions was a blue-serge suit, red tie, and derby hat.",
        "Windrip himself did wear a topper, but he saw to it that Lee Sarason saw to it that the one hundred and thirty million plain citizens learned, by radio, even while the inaugural parade was going on, that he had borrowed the topper for this one sole occasion from a New York Republican Representative who had ancestors.",
        "But following Windrip was an un-Jacksonian escort of soldiers: the American Legion and, immensely grander than the others, the Minute Men, wearing trench helmets of polished silver and led by Colonel Dewey Haik in scarlet tunic and yellow riding-breeches and helmet with golden plumes.",
        "Solemnly, for once looking a little awed, a little like a small-town boy on Broadway, Windrip took the oath, administered by the Chief Justice (who disliked him very much indeed) and, edging even closer to the microphone, squawked, \"My fellow citizens, as the President of the United States of America, I want to inform you that the real New Deal has started right this minute, and we're all going to enjoy the manifold liberties to which our history entitles us—and have a whale of a good time doing it!",
        "I thank you!\"\r\n\r\nThat was his first act as President.",
        "His second was to take up residence in the White House, where he sat down in the East Room in his stocking feet and shouted at Lee Sarason, \"This is what I've been planning to do now for six years!",
        "I bet this is what Lincoln used to do!",
        "Now let 'em assassinate me!\"\r\n\r\nHis third, in his role as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, was to order that the Minute Men be recognized as an unpaid but official auxiliary of the Regular Army, subject only to their own officers, to Buzz, and to High Marshal Sarason; and that rifles, bayonets, automatic pistols, and machine guns be instantly issued to them by government arsenals.",
        "That was at 4 P.M.",
        "Since 3 P.M., all over the country, bands of M.M.'s had been sitting gloating over pistols and guns, twitching with desire to seize them.",
        "Fourth coup was a special message, next morning, to Congress (in session since January fourth, the third having been a Sunday), demanding the instant passage of a bill embodying Point Fifteen of his election platform—that he should have complete control of legislation and execution, and the Supreme Court be rendered incapable of blocking anything that it might amuse him to do.",
        "By Joint Resolution, with less than half an hour of debate, both houses of Congress rejected that demand before 3 P.M., on January twenty-first.",
        "Before six, the President had proclaimed that a state of martial law existed during the \"present crisis,\" and more than a hundred Congressmen had been arrested by Minute Men, on direct orders from the President.",
        "The Congressmen who were hotheaded enough to resist were cynically charged with \"inciting to riot\"; they who went quietly were not charged at all.",
        "It was blandly explained to the agitated press by Lee Sarason that these latter quiet lads had been so threatened by \"irresponsible and seditious elements\" that they were merely being safeguarded.",
        "Sarason did not use the phrase \"protective arrest,\" which might have suggested things.",
        "To the veteran reporters it was strange to see the titular Secretary of State, theoretically a person of such dignity and consequence that he could deal with the representatives of foreign powers, acting as press-agent and yes-man for even the President.",
        "There were riots, instantly, all over Washington, all over America.",
        "The recalcitrant Congressmen had been penned in the District Jail.",
        "Toward it, in the winter evening, marched a mob that was noisily mutinous toward the Windrip for whom so many of them had voted.",
        "Among the mob buzzed hundreds of Negroes, armed with knives and old pistols, for one of the kidnaped Congressmen was a Negro from Georgia, the first colored Georgian to hold high office since carpetbagger days.",
        "Surrounding the jail, behind machine guns, the rebels found a few Regulars, many police, and a horde of Minute Men, but at these last they jeered, calling them \"Minnie Mouses\" and \"tin soldiers\" and \"mama's boys.\" The M.M.'s looked nervously at their officers and at the Regulars who were making so professional a pretense of not being scared.",
        "The mob heaved bottles and dead fish.",
        "Half-a-dozen policemen with guns and night sticks, trying to push back the van of the mob, were buried under a human surf and came up grotesquely battered and ununiformed—those who ever did come up again.",
        "There were two shots; and one Minute Man slumped to the jail steps, another stood ludicrously holding a wrist that spurted blood.",
        "The Minute Men—why, they said to themselves, they'd never meant to be soldiers anyway—just wanted to have some fun marching!",
        "They began to sneak into the edges of the mob, hiding their uniform caps.",
        "That instant, from a powerful loudspeaker in a lower window of the jail brayed the voice of President Berzelius Windrip:\r\n\r\n\"I am addressing my own boys, the Minute Men, everywhere in America!",
        "To you and you only I look for help to make America a proud, rich land again.",
        "You have been scorned.",
        "They thought you were the 'lower classes.' They wouldn't give you jobs.",
        "They told you to sneak off like bums and get relief.",
        "They ordered you into lousy C.C.C.",
        "camps.",
        "They said you were no good, because you were poor.",
        "I tell you that you are, ever since yesterday noon, the highest lords of the land—the aristocracy—the makers of the new America of freedom and justice.",
        "Boys!",
        "I need you!",
        "Help me—help me to help you!",
        "Stand fast!",
        "Anybody tries to block you—give the swine the point of your bayonet!\"\r\n\r\nA machine-gunner M.M., who had listened reverently, let loose.",
        "The mob began to drop, and into the backs of the wounded as they went staggering away the M.M.",
        "infantry, running, poked their bayonets.",
        "Such a juicy squash it made, and the fugitives looked so amazed, so funny, as they tumbled in grotesque heaps!",
        "The M.M.'s hadn't, in dreary hours of bayonet drill, known this would be such sport.",
        "They'd have more of it now—and hadn't the President of the United States himself told each of them, personally, that he needed their aid?",
        "When the remnants of Congress ventured to the Capitol, they found it seeded with M.M.'s, while a regiment of Regulars, under Major General Meinecke, paraded the grounds.",
        "The Speaker of the House, and the Hon.",
        "Mr.",
        "Perley Beecroft, Vice- President of the United States and Presiding Officer of the Senate, had the power to declare that quorums were present.",
        "(If a lot of members chose to dally in the district jail, enjoying themselves instead of attending Congress, whose fault was that?) Both houses passed a resolution declaring Point Fifteen temporarily in effect, during the \"crisis\"—the legality of the passage was doubtful, but just who was to contest it, even though the members of the Supreme Court had not been placed under protective arrest...",
        "merely confined each to his own house by a squad of Minute Men!",
        "Bishop Paul Peter Prang had (his friends said afterward) been dismayed by Windrip's stroke of state.",
        "Surely, he complained, Mr.",
        "Windrip hadn't quite remembered to include Christian Amity in the program he had taken from the League of Forgotten Men.",
        "Though Mr.",
        "Prang had contentedly given up broadcasting ever since the victory of Justice and Fraternity in the person of Berzelius Windrip, he wanted to caution the public again, but when he telephoned to his familiar station, WLFM in Chicago, the manager informed him that \"just temporarily, all access to the air was forbidden,\" except as it was especially licensed by the offices of Lee Sarason.",
        "(Oh, that was only one of sixteen jobs that Lee and his six hundred new assistants had taken on in the past week.)\r\n\r\nRather timorously, Bishop Prang motored from his home in Persepolis, Indiana, to the Indianapolis airport and took a night plane for Washington, to reprove, perhaps even playfully to spank, his naughty disciple, Buzz.",
        "He had little trouble in being admitted to see the President.",
        "In fact, he was, the press feverishly reported, at the White House for six hours, though whether he was with the President all that time they could not discover.",
        "At three in the afternoon Prang was seen to leave by a private entrance to the executive offices and take a taxi.",
        "They noted that he was pale and staggering.",
        "In front of his hotel he was elbowed by a mob who in curiously unmenacing and mechanical tones yelped, \"Lynch um—downutha enemies Windrip!\" A dozen M.M.'s pierced the crowd and surrounded the Bishop.",
        "The Ensign commanding them bellowed to the crowd, so that all might hear, \"You cowards leave the Bishop alone!",
        "Bishop, come with us, and we'll see you're safe!\"\r\n\r\nMillions heard on their radios that evening the official announcement that, to ward off mysterious plotters, probably Bolsheviks, Bishop Prang had been safely shielded in the district jail.",
        "And with it a personal statement from President Windrip that he was filled with joy at having been able to \"rescue from the foul agitators my friend and mentor, Bishop P.",
        "P.",
        "Prang, than whom there is no man living who I so admire and respect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was, as yet, no absolute censorship of the press; only a confused imprisonment of journalists who offended the government or local officers of the M.M.'s; and the papers chronically opposed to Windrip carried by no means flattering hints that Bishop Prang had rebuked the President and been plain jailed, with no nonsense about a \"rescue.\" These mutters reached Persepolis.",
        "Not all the Persepolitans ached with love for the Bishop or considered him a modern St.",
        "Francis gathering up the little fowls of the fields in his handsome LaSalle car.",
        "There were neighbors who hinted that he was a window-peeping snooper after bootleggers and obliging grass widows.",
        "But proud of him, their best advertisement, they certainly were, and the Persepolis Chamber of Commerce had caused to be erected at the Eastern gateway to Main Street the sign: \"Home of Bishop Prang, Radio's Greatest Star.\"\r\n\r\nSo as one man Persepolis telegraphed to Washington, demanding Prang's release, but a messenger in the Executive Offices who was a Persepolis boy (he was, it is true, a colored man, but suddenly he became a favorite son, lovingly remembered by old schoolmates) tipped off the Mayor that the telegrams were among the hundredweight of messages that were daily hauled away from the White House unanswered.",
        "Then a quarter of the citizenry of Persepolis mounted a special train to \"march\" on Washington.",
        "It was one of those small incidents which the opposition press could use as a bomb under Windrip, and the train was accompanied by a score of high-ranking reporters from Chicago and, later, from Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and New York.",
        "While the train was on its way—and it was curious what delays and sidetrackings it encountered—a company of Minute Men at Logansport, Indiana, rebelled against having to arrest a group of Catholic nuns who were accused of having taught treasonably.",
        "High Marshal Sarason felt that there must be a Lesson, early and impressive.",
        "A battalion of M.M.'s, sent from Chicago in fast trucks, arrested the mutinous company, and shot every third man.",
        "When the Persepolitans reached Washington, they were tearfully informed, by a brigadier of M.M.'s who met them at the Union Station, that poor Bishop Prang had been so shocked by the treason of his fellow Indianans that he had gone melancholy mad and they had tragically been compelled to shut him up in St.",
        "Elizabeth's government insane asylum.",
        "No one willing to carry news about him ever saw Bishop Prang again.",
        "The Brigadier brought greetings to the Persepolitans from the President himself, and an invitation to stay at the Willard, at government expense.",
        "Only a dozen accepted; the rest took the first train back, not amiably; and from then on there was one town in America in which no M.M.",
        "ever dared to appear in his ducky forage cap and dark-blue tunic.",
        "The Chief of Staff of the Regular Army had been deposed; in his place was Major General Emmanuel Coon.",
        "Doremus and his like were disappointed by General Coon's acceptance, for they had always been informed, even by the Nation, that Emmanuel Coon, though a professional army officer who did enjoy a fight, preferred that that fight be on the side of the Lord; that he was generous, literate, just, and a man of honor—and honor was the one quality that Buzz Windrip wasn't even expected to understand.",
        "Rumor said that Coon (as \"Nordic\" a Kentuckian as ever existed, a descendant of men who had fought beside Kit Carson and Commodore Perry) was particularly impatient with the puerility of anti-Semitism, and that nothing so pleased him as, when he heard new acquaintances being superior about the Jews, to snarl, \"Did you by any chance happen to notice that my name is Emmanuel Coon and that Coon might be a corruption of some name rather familiar on the East Side of New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh well, I suppose even General Coon feels, 'Orders are Orders,'\" sighed Doremus.",
        "President Windrip's first extended proclamation to the country was a pretty piece of literature and of tenderness.",
        "He explained that powerful and secret enemies of American principles—one rather gathered that they were a combination of Wall Street and Soviet Russia—upon discovering, to their fury, that he, Berzelius, was going to be President, had planned their last charge.",
        "Everything would be tranquil in a few months, but meantime there was a Crisis, during which the country must \"bear with him.\"\r\n\r\nHe recalled the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War, when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.",
        "He hinted how delightful everything was going to be— right away now—just a moment—just a moment's patience—when he had things in hand; and he wound up with a comparison of the Crisis to the urgency of a fireman rescuing a pretty girl from a \"conflagration,\" and carrying her down a ladder, for her own sake, whether she liked it or not, and no matter how appealingly she might kick her pretty ankles.",
        "The whole country laughed.",
        "\"Great card, that Buzz, but mighty competent guy,\" said the electorate.",
        "\"I should worry whether Bish Prang or any other nut is in the boobyhatch, long as I get my five thousand bucks a year, like Windrip promised,\" said Shad Ledue to Charley Betts, the furniture man.",
        "It had all happened within the eight days following Windrip's inauguration.",
        "CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nI HAVE no desire to be President.",
        "I would much rather do my humble best as a supporter of Bishop Prang, Ted Bilbo, Gene Talmadge or any other broad-gauged but peppy Liberal.",
        "My only longing is to Serve.",
        "Zero Hour, Berzelius Windrip.",
        "LIKE many bachelors given to vigorous hunting and riding, Buck Titus was a fastidious housekeeper, and his mid-Victorian farmhouse fussily neat.",
        "It was also pleasantly bare: the living room a monastic hall of heavy oak chairs, tables free of dainty covers, numerous and rather solemn books of history and exploration, with the conventional \"sets,\" and a tremendous fireplace of rough stone.",
        "And the ash trays were solid pottery and pewter, able to cope with a whole evening of cigarette-smoking.",
        "The whisky stood honestly on the oak buffet, with siphons, and with cracked ice always ready in a thermos jug.",
        "It would, however, have been too much to expect Buck Titus not to have red-and-black imitation English hunting-prints.",
        "This hermitage, always grateful to Doremus, was sanctuary now, and only with Buck could he adequately damn Windrip & Co.",
        "and people like Francis Tasbrough, who in February was still saying, \"Yes, things do look kind of hectic down there in Washington, but that's just because there's so many of these bullheaded politicians that still think they can buck Windrip.",
        "Besides, anyway, things like that couldn't ever happen here in New England.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, as Doremus went on his lawful occasions past the red-brick Georgian houses, the slender spires of old white churches facing the Green, as he heard the lazy irony of familiar greetings from his acquaintances, men as enduring as their Vermont hills, it seemed to him that the madness in the capital was as alien and distant and unimportant as an earthquake in Tibet.",
        "Constantly, in the Informer, he criticized the government but not too acidly.",
        "The hysteria can't last; be patient, and wait and see, he counseled his readers.",
        "It was not that he was afraid of the authorities.",
        "He simply did not believe that this comic tyranny could endure.",
        "It can't happen here, said even Doremus—even now.",
        "The one thing that most perplexed him was that there could be a dictator seemingly so different from the fervent Hitlers and gesticulating Fascists and the Cæsars with laurels round bald domes; a dictator with something of the earthy American sense of humor of a Mark Twain, a George Ade, a Will Rogers, an Artemus Ward.",
        "Windrip could be ever so funny about solemn jaw-drooping opponents, and about the best method of training what he called \"a Siamese flea hound.\" Did that, puzzled Doremus, make him less or more dangerous?",
        "Then he remembered the most cruel-mad of all pirates, Sir Henry Morgan, who had thought it ever so funny to sew a victim up in wet rawhide and watch it shrink in the sun.",
        "From the perseverance with which they bickered, you could tell that Buck Titus and Lorinda were much fonder of each other than they would admit.",
        "Being a person who read little and therefore took what he did read seriously, Buck was distressed by the normally studious Lorinda's vacation liking for novels about distressed princesses, and when she airily insisted that they were better guides to conduct than Anthony Trollope or Thomas Hardy, Buck roared at her and, in the feebleness of baited strength, nervously filled pipes and knocked them out against the stone mantel.",
        "But he approved of the relationship between Doremus and Lorinda, which only he (and Shad Ledue!) had guessed, and over Doremus, ten years his senior, this shaggy-headed woodsman fussed like a thwarted spinster.",
        "To both Doremus and Lorinda, Buck's overgrown shack became their refuge.",
        "And they needed it, late in February, five weeks or thereabouts after Windrip's election.",
        "Despite strikes and riots all over the country, bloodily put down by the Minute Men, Windrip's power in Washington was maintained.",
        "The most liberal four members of the Supreme Court resigned and were replaced by surprisingly unknown lawyers who called President Windrip by his first name.",
        "A number of Congressmen were still being \"protected\" in the District of Columbia jail; others had seen the blinding light forever shed by the goddess Reason and happily returned to the Capitol.",
        "The Minute Men were increasingly loyal— they were still unpaid volunteers, but provided with \"expense accounts\" considerably larger than the pay of the regular troops.",
        "Never in American history had the adherents of a President been so well satisfied; they were not only appointed to whatever political jobs there were but to ever so many that really were not; and with such annoyances as Congressional Investigations hushed, the official awarders of contracts were on the merriest of terms with all contractors....",
        "One veteran lobbyist for steel corporations complained that there was no more sport in his hunting—you were not only allowed but expected to shoot all government purchasing-agents sitting.",
        "None of the changes was so publicized as the Presidential mandate abruptly ending the separate existence of the different states, and dividing the whole country into eight \"provinces\"—thus, asserted Windrip, economizing by reducing the number of governors and all other state officers and, asserted Windrip's enemies, better enabling him to concentrate his private army and hold the country.",
        "The new \"Northeastern Province\" included all of New York State north of a line through Ossining, and all of New England except a strip of Connecticut shore as far east as New Haven.",
        "This was, Doremus admitted, a natural and homogeneous division, and even more natural seemed the urban and industrial \"Metropolitan Province,\" which included Greater New York, Westchester County up to Ossining, Long Island, the strip of Connecticut dependent on New York City, New Jersey, northern Delaware, and Pennsylvania as far as Reading and Scranton.",
        "Each province was divided into numbered districts, each district into lettered counties, each county into townships and cities, and only in these last did the old names, with their traditional appeal, remain to endanger President Windrip by memories of honorable local history.",
        "And it was gossiped that, next, the government would change even the town names—that they were already thinking fondly of calling New York \"Berzelian\" and San Francisco \"San Sarason.\" Probably that gossip was false.",
        "The Northeastern Province's six districts were: 1, Upper New York State west of and including Syracuse; 2, New York east of it; 3, Vermont and New Hampshire; 4, Maine; 5, Massachusetts; 6, Rhode Island and the unraped portion of Connecticut.",
        "District 3, Doremus Jessup's district, was divided into the four \"counties\" of southern and northern Vermont, and southern and northern New Hampshire, with Hanover for capital—the District Commissioner merely chased the Dartmouth students out and took over the college buildings for his offices, to the considerable approval of Amherst, Williams, and Yale.",
        "So Doremus was living, now, in Northeastern Province, District 3, County B, township of Beulah, and over him for his admiration and rejoicing were a provincial commissioner, a district commissioner, a county commissioner, an assistant county commissioner in charge of Beulah Township, and all their appertaining M.M.",

        "In the end, despite his uncounted competitors, it was the great mystic, Lee Sarason himself, who found the perfect new emblem—a ship's steering wheel.",
        "It symbolized, he pointed out, not only the Ship of State but also the wheels of American industry, the wheels and the steering wheel of motorcars, the wheel diagram which Father Coughlin had suggested two years before as symbolizing the program of the National Union for Social Justice, and, particularly, the wheel emblem of the Rotary Club.",
        "Sarason's proclamation also pointed out that it would not be too far-fetched to declare that, with a little drafting treatment, the arms of the Swastika could be seen as unquestionably related to the circle, and how about the K.K.K.",

        "That description would more correctly, and increasingly, have applied to their enemies.",
        "Though the Corpos continued to promise a gift of at least $5000 to every family, \"as soon as funding of the required bond issue shall be completed,\" the actual management of the poor, particularly of the more surly and dissatisfied poor, was undertaken by the Minute Men.",

        "Their wives and children accompanied them and took care of the cooking, cleaning, and repair of clothes.",
        "The men did not merely work on state projects; they were also hired out at the reasonable rate of one dollar a day to private employers.",
        "Of course, so selfish is human nature even in Utopia, this did cause most employers to discharge the men to whom they had been paying more than a dollar a day, but that took care of itself, because these overpaid malcontents in their turn were forced into the labor camps.",
        "Out of their dollar a day, the workers in the camps had to pay from seventy to ninety cents a day for board and lodging.",
        "There was a certain discontentment among people who had once owned motorcars and bathrooms and eaten meat twice daily, at having to walk ten or twenty miles a day, bathe once a week, along with fifty others, in a long trough, get meat only twice a week—when they got it—and sleep in bunks, a hundred in a room.",
        "Yet there was less rebellion than a mere rationalist like Walt Trowbridge, Windrip's ludicrously defeated rival, would have expected, for every evening the loudspeaker brought to the workers the precious voices of Windrip and Sarason, Vice-President Beecroft, Secretary of War Luthorne, Secretary of Education and Propaganda Macgoblin, General Coon, or some other genius, and these Olympians, talking to the dirtiest and tiredest mudsills as warm friend to friend, told them that they were the honored foundation stones of a New Civilization, the advance guards of the conquest of the whole world.",
        "They took it, too, like Napoleon's soldiers.",

        "Each week the government said less about the findings of the board of inquiry which was to decide how the $5000 per person could be wangled.",

        "For example, inflation.",
        "In America of this period, inflation did not even compare with the German inflation of the 1920's, but it was sufficient.",
        "The wage in the labor camps had to be raised from a dollar a day to three, with which the workers were receiving an equivalent of sixty cents a day in 1914 values.",
        "Everybody delightfully profited, except the very poor, the common workmen, the skilled workmen, the small business men, the professional men, and old couples living on annuities or their savings—these last did really suffer a little, as their incomes were cut in three.",
        "The workers, with apparently tripled wages, saw the cost of everything in the shops much more than triple.",
        "Agriculture, which was most of all to have profited from inflation, on the theory that the mercurial crop-prices would rise faster than anything else, actually suffered the most of all, because, after a first flurry of foreign buying, importers of American products found it impossible to deal in so skittish a market, and American food exports—such of them as were left—ceased completely.",
        "It was Big Business, that ancient dragon which Bishop Prang and Senator Windrip had gone forth to slay, that had the interesting time.",
        "With the value of the dollar changing daily, the elaborate systems of cost-marking and credit of Big Business were so confused that presidents and sales-managers sat in their offices after midnight, with wet towels.",
        "But they got some comfort, because with the depreciated dollar they were able to recall all bonded indebtedness and, paying it off at the old face values, get rid of it at thirty cents on the hundred.",
        "With this, and the currency so wavering that employees did not know just what they ought to get in wages, and labor unions eliminated, the larger industrialists came through the inflation with perhaps double the wealth, in real values, that they had had in 1936.",
        "And two other planks in Windrip's encyclical vigorously respected were those eliminating the Negroes and patronizing the Jews.",
        "The former race took it the less agreeably.",
        "There were horrible instances in which whole Southern counties with a majority of Negro population were overrun by the blacks and all property seized.",
        "True, their leaders alleged that this followed massacres of Negroes by Minute Men.",
        "But as Dr.",
        "Macgoblin, Secretary of Culture, so well said, this whole subject was unpleasant and therefore not helpful to discuss.",
        "All over the country, the true spirit of Windrip's Plank Nine, regarding the Jews, was faithfully carried out.",
        "It was understood that the Jews were no longer to be barred from fashionable hotels, as in the hideous earlier day of race prejudice, but merely to be charged double rates.",
        "It was understood that Jews were never to be discouraged from trading but were merely to pay higher graft to commissioners and inspectors and to accept without debate all regulations, wage rates, and price lists decided upon by the stainless Anglo-Saxons of the various merchants' associations.",
        "And that all Jews of all conditions were frequently to sound their ecstasy in having found in America a sanctuary, after their deplorable experiences among the prejudices of Europe.",
        "In Fort Beulah, Louis Rotenstern, since he had always been the first to stand up for the older official national anthems, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" or \"Dixie,\" and now for \"Buzz and Buzz,\" since he had of old been considered almost an authentic friend by Francis Tasbrough and R.",

        "But one Harry Kindermann, a Jew who had profiteered enough as agent for maple-sugar and dairy machinery so that in 1936 he had been paying the last installment on his new bungalow and on his Buick, had always been what Shad Ledue called \"a fresh Kike.\" He had laughed at the flag, the Church, and even Rotary.",
        "Now he found the manufacturers canceling his agencies, without explanation.",
        "By the middle of 1937 he was selling frankfurters by the road, and his wife, who had been so proud of the piano and the old American pine cupboard in their bungalow, was dead, from pneumonia caught in the one-room tar-paper shack into which they had moved.",
        "At the time of Windrip's election, there had been more than 80,000 relief administrators employed by the federal and local governments in America.",
        "With the labor camps absorbing most people on relief, this army of social workers, both amateurs and long-trained professional uplifters, was stranded.",
        "The Minute Men controlling the labor camps were generous: they offered the charitarians the same dollar a day that the proletarians received, with special low rates for board and lodging.",
        "But the cleverer social workers received a much better offer: to help list every family and every unmarried person in the country, with his or her finances, professional ability, military training and, most important and most tactfully to be ascertained, his or her secret opinion of the M.M.'s and of the Corpos in general.",
        "A good many of the social workers indignantly said that this was asking them to be spies, stool pigeons for the American Oh Gay Pay Oo.",
        "These were, on various unimportant charges, sent to jail or, later, to concentration camps—which were also jails, but the private jails of the M.M.'s, unshackled by any old-fashioned, nonsensical prison regulations.",
        "In the confusion of the summer and early autumn of 1937, local M.M.",

        "To end this cowardly flight of the lying counter revolutionists (many of whom, once accepted as reputable preachers and lawyers and doctors and writers and ex-congressmen and ex-army officers, were able to give a wickedly false impression of Corpoism and the M.M.'s to the world outside America) the government quadrupled the guards who were halting suspects at every harbor and at even the minutest trails crossing the border; and in one quick raid, it poured M.M.",

        "Trowbridge remained prosaically on a ranch he owned in South Dakota, and the government agent commanding the M.M.'s (a skilled man, trained in breaking strikes) reported that on his tapped telephone wire and in his steamed-open letters, Trowbridge communicated nothing more seditious than reports on growing alfalfa.",

        "Not till they had almost reached the courthouse could he realize that people were looking at him—at Doremus Jessup!—as a prisoner being taken to jail.",
        "He tried to be proud of being a political prisoner.",
        "He couldn't.",
        "Jail was jail.",
        "The county lockup was at the back of the courthouse, now the center of Ledue's headquarters.",
        "Doremus had never been in that or any other jail except as a reporter, pityingly interviewing the curious, inferior sort of people who did mysteriously get themselves arrested.",
        "To go into that shameful back door—he who had always stalked into the front entrance of the courthouse, the editor, saluted by clerk and sheriff and judge!",
        "Shad was not in sight.",
        "Silently Doremus's four guards conducted him through a steel door, down a corridor, to a small cell reeking of chloride of lime and, still unspeaking, they left him there.",
        "The cell had a cot with a damp straw mattress and damper straw pillow, a stool, a wash basin with one tap for cold water, a pot, two hooks for clothes, a small barred window, and nothing else whatever except a jaunty sign ornamented with embossed forget-me-nots and a text from Deuteronomy, \"He shall be free at home one year.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so!\" said Doremus, not very cordially.",
        "It was before nine in the morning.",
        "He remained in that cell, without speech, without food, with only tap water caught in his doubled palm and with one cigarette an hour, until after midnight, and in the unaccustomed stillness he saw how in prison men could eventually go mad.",
        "\"Don't whine, though.",
        "You here a few hours, and plenty of poor devils in solitary for years and years, put there by tyrants worse than Windrip...",
        "yes, and sometimes put there by nice, good, social-minded judges that I've played bridge with!\"\r\n\r\nBut the reasonableness of the thought didn't particularly cheer him.",
        "He could hear a distant babble from the bull pen, where the drunks and vagrants, and the petty offenders among the M.M.'s, were crowded in enviable comradeship, but the sound was only a background for the corroding stillness.",
        "He sank into a twitching numbness.",
        "He felt that he was choking, and gasped desperately.",
        "Only now and then did he think clearly— then only of the shame of imprisonment or, even more emphatically, of how hard the wooden stool was on his ill-upholstered rump, and how much pleasanter it was, even so, than the cot, whose mattress had the quality of crushed worms.",
        "Once he felt that he saw the way clearly:\r\n\r\n\"The tyranny of this dictatorship isn't primarily the fault of Big Business, nor of the demagogues who do their dirty work.",
        "It's the fault of Doremus Jessup!",
        "Of all the conscientious, respectable, lazy-minded Doremus Jessups who have let the demagogues wriggle in, without fierce enough protest.",
        "\"A few months ago I thought the slaughter of the Civil War, and the agitation of the violent Abolitionists who helped bring it on, were evil.",
        "But possibly they had to be violent, because easy-going citizens like me couldn't be stirred up otherwise.",
        "If our grandfathers had had the alertness and courage to see the evils of slavery and of a government conducted by gentlemen for gentlemen only, there wouldn't have been any need of agitators and war and blood.",
        "\"It's my sort, the Responsible Citizens who've felt ourselves superior because we've been well-to-do and what we thought was 'educated,' who brought on the Civil War, the French Revolution, and now the Fascist Dictatorship.",
        "It's I who murdered Rabbi de Verez.",
        "It's I who persecuted the Jews and the Negroes.",
        "I can blame no Aras Dilley, no Shad Ledue, no Buzz Windrip, but only my own timid soul and drowsy mind.",
        "Forgive, O Lord!",
        "\"Is it too late?\"\r\n\r\nOnce again, as darkness was coming into his cell like the inescapable ooze of a flood, he thought furiously:\r\n\r\n\"And about Lorinda.",
        "Now that I've been kicked into reality—got to be one thing or the other: Emma (who's my bread) or Lorinda (my wine) but I can't have both.",
        "\"Oh, damn!",
        "What twaddle!",
        "Why can't a man have both bread and wine and not prefer one before the other?",
        "\"Unless, maybe, we're all coming into a day of battles when the fighting will be too hot to let a man stop for anything save bread...",
        "and maybe, even, too hot to let him stop for that!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe waiting—the waiting in the smothering cell—the relentless waiting while the filthy window glass turned from afternoon to a bleak darkness.",
        "What was happening out there?",
        "What had happened to Emma, to Lorinda, to the Informer office, to Dan Wilgus, to Buck and Sissy and Mary and David?",
        "Why, it was today that Lorinda was to answer the action against her by Nipper!",
        "Today!",
        "(Surely all that must have been done with a year ago!) What had happened?",
        "Had Military Judge Effingham Swan treated her as she deserved?",
        "But Doremus slipped again from this living agitation into the trance of waiting—waiting; and, catnapping on the hideously uncomfortable little stool, he was dazed when at some unholily late hour (it was just after midnight) he was aroused by the presence of armed M.M.'s outside his barred cell door, and by the hill-billy drawl of Squad Leader Aras Dilley:\r\n\r\n\"Well, guess y' better git up now, better git up!",
        "Jedge wants to see you—jedge says he wants to see you.",
        "Heh!",
        "Guess y' didn't ever think I'd be a squad leader, did yuh, Mist' Jessup!\"\r\n\r\nDoremus was escorted through angling corridors to the familiar side entrance of the courtroom—the entrance where once he had seen Thad Dilley, Aras's degenerate cousin, shamble in to receive sentence for clubbing his wife to death....",
        "He could not keep from feeling that Thad and he were kin, now.",
        "He was kept waiting—waiting!—for a quarter hour outside the closed courtroom door.",
        "He had time to consider the three guards commanded by Squad Leader Aras.",
        "He happened to know that one of them had served a sentence at Windsor for robbery with assault; and one, a surly young farmer, had been rather doubtfully acquitted on a charge of barn-burning in revenge against a neighbor.",
        "He leaned against the slightly dirty gray plaster wall of the corridor.",
        "\"Stand straight there, you!",
        "What the hell do you think this is?",
        "And keeping us up late like this!\" said the rejuvenated, the redeemed Aras, waggling his bayonet and shining with desire to use it on the bourjui.",
        "Doremus stood straight.",
        "He stood very straight, he stood rigid, beneath a portrait of Horace Greeley.",
        "Till now, Doremus had liked to think of that most famous of radical editors, who had been a printer in Vermont from 1825 to 1828, as his colleague and comrade.",
        "Now he felt colleague only to the revolutionary Karl Pascals.",
        "His legs, not too young, were trembling; his calves ached.",
        "Was he going to faint?",
        "What was happening in there, in the courtroom?",
        "To save himself from the disgrace of collapsing, he studied Aras Dilley.",
        "Though his uniform was fairly new, Aras had managed to deal with it as his family and he had dealt with their house on Mount Terror—once a sturdy Vermont cottage with shining white clapboards, now mud-smeared and rotting.",
        "His cap was crushed in, his breeches spotted, his leggings gaping, and one tunic button hung by a thread.",
        "\"I wouldn't particularly want to be dictator over an Aras, but I most particularly do not want him and his like to be dictators over me, whether they call them Fascists or Corpos or Communists or Monarchists or Free Democratic Electors or anything else!",
        "If that makes me a reactionary kulak, all right!",
        "I don't believe I ever really liked the shiftless brethren, for all my lying hand-shaking.",
        "Do you think the Lord calls on us to love the cowbirds as much as the swallows?",
        "I don't!",
        "Oh, I know; Aras has had a hard time: mortgage and seven kids.",
        "But Cousin Henry Veeder and Dan Wilgus— yes, and Pete Vutong, the Canuck, that lives right across the road from Aras and has just exactly the same kind of land—they were all born poor, and they've lived decently enough.",
        "They can wash their ears and their door sills, at least.",
        "I'm cursed if I'm going to give up the American-Wesleyan doctrine of Free Will and of Will to Accomplishment entirely, even if it does get me read out of the Liberal Communion!\"\r\n\r\nAras had peeped into the courtroom, and he stood giggling.",
        "Then Lorinda came out—after midnight!",
        "Her partner, the wart Nipper, was following her, looking sheepishly triumphant.",
        "\"Linda!",
        "Linda!\" called Doremus, his hands out, ignoring the snickers of the curious guards, trying to move toward her.",
        "Aras pushed him back and at Lorinda sneered, \"Go on—move on, there!\" and she moved.",
        "She seemed twisted and rusty as Doremus would have thought her bright steeliness could never have been.",
        "Aras cackled, \"Haa, haa, haa!",
        "Your friend, Sister Pike—\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife's friend!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, boss.",
        "Have it your way!",
        "Your wife's friend, Sister Pike, got hers for trying to be fresh with Judge Swan!",
        "She's been kicked out of her partnership with Mr.",
        "Nipper—he's going to manage that Tavern of theirn, and Sister Pike goes back to pot-walloping in the kitchen, like she'd ought to!—like maybe some of your womenfolks, that think they're so almighty stylish and independent, will be having to, pretty soon!\"\r\n\r\nAgain Doremus had sense enough to regard the bayonets; and a mighty voice from inside the courtroom trumpeted: \"Next case!",
        "D.",
        "Jessup!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the judges' bench were Shad Ledue in uniform as an M.M.",
        "battalion leader, ex-superintendent Emil Staubmeyer presenting the rôle of ensign, and a third man, tall, rather handsome, rather too face-massaged, with the letters \"M.J.\" on the collar of his uniform as commander, or pseudo-colonel.",
        "He was perhaps fifteen years younger than Doremus.",
        "This, Doremus knew, must be Military Judge Effingham Swan, sometime of Boston.",
        "The Minute Men marched him in front of the bench and retired, with only two of them, a milky-faced farm boy and a former gas-station attendant, remaining on guard inside the double doors of the side entrance...",
        "the entrance for criminals.",
        "Commander Swan loafed to his feet and, as though he were greeting his oldest friend, cooed at Doremus, \"My dear fellow, so sorry to have to trouble you.",
        "Just a routine query, you know.",
        "Do sit down.",
        "Gentlemen, in the case of Mr.",
        "Doremus, surely we need not go through the farce of formal inquiry.",
        "Let's all sit about that damn big silly table down there—place where they always stick the innocent defendants and the guilty attorneys, y' know—get down from this high altar—little too mystical for the taste of a vulgar bucket-shop gambler like myself.",
        "After you, Professor; after you, my dear Captain.\" And, to the guards, \"Just wait outside in the hall, will you?",
        "Close the doors.\"\r\n\r\nStaubmeyer and Shad looking, despite Effingham Swan's frivolity, as portentous as their uniforms could make them, clumped down to the table.",
        "Swan followed them airily, and to Doremus, still standing, he gave his tortoise-shell cigarette case, caroling, \"Do have a smoke, Mr.",
        "Doremus.",
        "Must we all be so painfully formal?\"\r\n\r\nDoremus reluctantly took a cigarette, reluctantly sat down as Swan waved him to a chair—with something not quite so airy and affable in the sharpness of the gesture.",
        "\"My name is Jessup, Commander.",
        "Doremus is my first name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I see.",
        "It could be.",
        "Quite so.",
        "Very New England.",
        "Doremus.\" Swan was leaning back in his wooden armchair, powerful trim hands behind his neck.",
        "\"I'll tell you, my dear fellow.",
        "One's memory is so wretched, you know.",
        "I'll just call you 'Doremus,' sans Mister.",
        "Then, d' you see, it might apply to either the first (or Christian, as I believe one's wretched people in Back Bay insist on calling it)—either the Christian or the surname.",
        "Then we shall feel all friendly and secure.",
        "Now, Doremus, my dear fellow, I begged my friends in the M.M.—I do trust they were not too importunate, as these parochial units sometimes do seem to be—but I ordered them to invite you here, really, just to get your advice as a journalist.",
        "Does it seem to you that most of the peasants here are coming to their senses and ready to accept the Corpo fait accompli?\"\r\n\r\nDoremus grumbled, \"But I understood I was dragged here—and if you want to know, your squad was all of what you call 'importunate'!— because of an editorial I wrote about President Windrip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, was that you, Doremus?",
        "You see?—I was right—one does have such a wretched memory!",
        "I do seem now to remember some minor incident of the sort—you know—mentioned in the agenda.",
        "Do have another cigarette, my dear fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swan!",
        "I don't care much for this cat-and-mouse game—at least, not while I'm the mouse.",
        "What are your charges against me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Charges?",
        "Oh, my only aunt!",
        "Just trifling things—criminal libel and conveying secret information to alien forces and high treason and homicidal incitement to violence—you know, the usual boresome line.",
        "And all so easily got rid of, my Doremus, if you'd just be persuaded—you see how quite pitifully eager I am to be friendly with you, and to have the inestimable aid of your experience here— if you'd just decide that it might be the part of discretion—so suitable, y' know, to your venerable years—\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn it, I'm not venerable, nor anything like it.",
        "Only sixty.",
        "Sixty-one, I should say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Matter of ratio, my dear fellow.",
        "I'm forty-seven m'self, and I have no doubt the young pups already call me venerable!",
        "But as I was saying, Doremus—\"\r\n\r\n(Why was it he winced with fury every time Swan called him that?)\r\n\r\n\"—with your position as one of the Council of Elders, and with your responsibilities to your family—it would be too sick-making if anything happened to them, y' know!—you just can't afford to be too brash!",
        "And all we desire is for you to play along with us in your paper—I would adore the chance of explaining some of the Corpos' and the Chief's still unrevealed plans to you.",
        "You'd see such a new light!\"\r\n\r\nShad grunted, \"Him?",
        "Jessup couldn't see a new light if it was on the end of his nose!\"\r\n\r\n\"A moment, my dear Captain....",
        "And also, Doremus, of course we shall urge you to help us by giving us a complete list of every person in this vicinity that you know of who is secretly opposed to the Administration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spying?",
        "Me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I'm accused of—I insist on having my lawyer, Mungo Kitterick, and on being tried, not all this bear-baiting—\"\r\n\r\n\"Quaint name.",
        "Mungo Kitterick!",
        "Oh, my only aunt!",
        "Why does it give me so absurd a picture of an explorer with a Greek grammar in his hand?",
        "You don't quite understand, my Doremus.",
        "Habeas corpus— due processes of law—too, too bad!—all those ancient sanctities, dating, no doubt, from Magna Charta, been suspended—oh, but just temporarily, y' know—state of crisis—unfortunate necessity martial law—\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn it, Swan—\"\r\n\r\n\"Commander, my dear fellow—ridiculous matter of military discipline, y' know—such rot!\"\r\n\r\n\"You know mighty well and good it isn't temporary!",
        "It's permanent— that is, as long as the Corpos last.\"\r\n\r\n\"It could be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Swan—Commander—you get that 'it could be' and 'my aunt' from the Reggie Fortune stories, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now there is a fellow detective-story fanatic!",
        "But how too bogus!\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's Evelyn Waugh!",
        "You're quite a literary man for so famous a yachtsman and horseman, Commander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horsemun, yachtsmun, lit-er-ary man!",
        "Am I, Doremus, even in my sanctum sanctorum, having, as the lesser breeds would say, the pants kidded off me?",
        "Oh, my Doremus, that couldn't be!",
        "And just when one is so feeble, after having been so, shall I say excoriated, by your so amiable friend, Mrs.",
        "Lorinda Pike?",
        "No, no!",
        "How too unbefitting the majesty of the law!\"\r\n\r\nShad interrupted again, \"Yeh, we had a swell time with your girl-friend, Jessup.",
        "But I already had the dope about you and her before.\"\r\n\r\nDoremus sprang up, his chair crashing backward on the floor.",
        "He was reaching for Shad's throat across the table.",
        "Effingham Swan was on him, pushing him back into another chair.",
        "Doremus hiccuped with fury.",
        "Shad had not even troubled to rise, and he was going on contemptuously:\r\n\r\n\"Yuh, you two'll have quite some trouble if you try to pull any spy stuff on the Corpos.",
        "My, my, Doremus, ain't we had fun, Lindy and you, playing footie-footie these last couple years!",
        "Didn't nobody know about it, did they!",
        "But what you didn't know was Lindy—and don't it beat hell a long-nosed, skinny old maid like her can have so much pep!—and she's been cheating on you right along, sleeping with every doggone man boarder she's had at the Tavern, and of course with her little squirt of a partner, Nipper!\"\r\n\r\nSwan's great hand—hand of an ape with a manicure—held Doremus in his chair.",
        "Shad snickered.",
        "Emil Staubmeyer, who had been sitting with fingertips together, laughed amiably.",
        "Swan patted Doremus's back.",
        "He was less sunken by the insult to Lorinda than by the feeling of helpless loneliness.",
        "It was so late; the night so quiet.",
        "He would have been glad if even the M.M.",
        "guards had come in from the hall.",
        "Their rustic innocence, however barnyardishly brutal, would have been comforting after the easy viciousness of the three judges.",
        "Swan was placidly resuming: \"But I suppose we really must get down to business—however agreeable, my dear clever literary detective, it would be to discuss Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers and Norman Klein.",
        "Perhaps we can some day, when the Chief puts us both in the same prison!",
        "There's really, my dear Doremus, no need of your troubling your legal gentleman, Mr.",
        "Monkey Kitteridge.",
        "I am quite authorized to conduct this trial—for quaintly enough, Doremus, it is a trial, despite the delightful St.",
        "Botolph's atmosphere!",
        "And as to testimony, I already have all I need, both in the good Miss Lorinda's inadvertent admissions, in the actual text of your editorial criticizing the Chief, and in the quite thorough reports of Captain Ledue and Dr.",
        "Staubmeyer.",
        "One really ought to take you out and shoot you—and one is quite empowered to do so, oh quite!—but one has one's faults—one is really too merciful.",
        "And perhaps we can find a better use for you than as fertilizer—you are, you know, rather too much on the skinny side to make adequate fertilizer.",
        "\"You are to be released on parole, to assist and coach Dr.",
        "Staubmeyer who, by orders from Commissioner Reek, at Hanover, has just been made editor of the Informer, but who doubtless lacks certain points of technical training.",

        "Then we'll see what we'll do with you!...",
        "You will write editorials, with all your accustomed brilliance—oh, I assure you, people constantly stop on Boston Common to discuss your masterpieces; have done for years!",
        "But you'll write only as Dr.",
        "Staubmeyer tells you.",
        "Understand?",
        "Oh.",
        "Today—since 'tis already past the witching hour—you will write an abject apology for your diatribe—oh yes, very much on the abject side!",
        "You know—you veteran journalists do these things so neatly—just admit you were a cockeyed liar and that sort of thing— bright and bantering—you know!",
        "And next Monday you will, like most of the other ditchwater-dull hick papers, begin the serial publication of the Chief's Zero Hour.",
        "You'll enjoy that!\"\r\n\r\nClatter and shouts at the door.",
        "Protests from the unseen guards.",
        "Dr.",
        "Fowler Greenhill pounding in, stopping with arms akimbo, shouting as he strode down to the table, \"What do you three comic judges think you're doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"And who may our impetuous friend be?",

        "It was in less than a minute that Aras Dilley was saluting from the door, and Shad was shouting, \"Come here!",
        "Grab this dirty crook!\" He pointed at Fowler.",
        "\"Take him along outside.\"\r\n\r\nThey did, for all of Fowler's struggling.",
        "Aras Dilley jabbed Fowler's right wrist with a bayonet.",
        "It spilled blood down on his hand, so scrubbed for surgery, and like blood his red hair tumbled over his forehead.",
        "Shad marched out with them, pulling his automatic pistol from its holster and looking at it happily.",
        "Doremus was held, his mouth was clapped shut, by two guards as he tried to reach Fowler.",
        "Emil Staubmeyer seemed a little scared, but Effingham Swan, suave and amused, leaned his elbows on the table and tapped his teeth with a pencil.",
        "From the courtyard, the sound of a rifle volley, a terrifying wail, one single emphatic shot, and nothing after.",
        "CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE real trouble with the Jews is that they are cruel.",
        "Anybody with a knowledge of history knows how they tortured poor debtors in secret catacombs, all through the Middle Ages.",
        "Whereas the Nordic is distinguished by his gentleness and his kind-heartedness to friends, children, dogs, and people of inferior races.",
        "Zero Hour, Berzelius Windrip.",
        "THE review in Dewey Haik's provincial court of Judge Swan's sentence on Greenhill was influenced by County Commissioner Ledue's testimony that after the execution he found in Greenhill's house a cache of the most seditious documents: copies of Trowbridge's Lance for Democracy, books by Marx and Trotzky, Communistic pamphlets urging citizens to assassinate the Chief.",
        "Mary, Mrs.",
        "Greenhill, insisted that her husband had never read such things; that, if anything, he had been too indifferent to politics.",
        "Naturally, her word could not be taken against that of Commissioner Ledue, Assistant Commissioner Staubmeyer (known everywhere as a scholar and man of probity), and Military Judge Effingham Swan.",
        "It was necessary to punish Mrs.",
        "Greenhill—or, rather, to give a strong warning to other Mrs.",
        "Greenhills—by seizing all the property and money Greenhill had left her.",
        "Anyway, Mary did not fight very vigorously.",
        "Perhaps she realized her guilt.",
        "In two days she turned from the crispest, smartest, most swift-spoken woman in Fort Beulah into a silent hag, dragging about in shabby and unkempt black.",
        "Her son and she went to live with her father, Doremus Jessup.",
        "Some said that Jessup should have fought for her and her property.",
        "But he was not legally permitted to do so.",
        "He was on parole, subject, at the will of the properly constituted authorities, to a penitentiary sentence.",
        "So Mary returned to the house and the overfurnished bedroom she had left as a bride.",
        "She could not, she said, endure its memories.",
        "She took the attic room that had never been quite \"finished off.\" She sat up there all day, all evening, and her parents never heard a sound.",
        "But within a week her David was playing about the yard most joyfully...",
        "playing that he was an M.M.",
        "officer.",
        "The whole house seemed dead, and all that were in it seemed frightened, nervous, forever waiting for something unknown—all save David and, perhaps, Mrs.",
        "Candy, bustling in her kitchen.",
        "Meals had been notoriously cheerful at the Jessups'; Doremus chattered to an audience of Mrs.",
        "Candy and Sissy, flustering Emma with the most outrageous assertions—that he was planning to go to Greenland; that President Windrip had taken to riding down Pennsylvania Avenue on an elephant; and Mrs.",
        "Candy was as unscrupulous as all good cooks in trying to render them speechlessly drowsy after dinner and to encourage the stealthy expansion of Doremus's already rotund little belly, with her mince pie, her apple pie with enough shortening to make the eyes pop out in sweet anguish, the fat corn fritters and candied potatoes with the broiled chicken, the clam chowder made with cream.",
        "Now, there was little talk among the adults at table and, though Mary was not showily \"brave,\" but colorless as a glass of water, they were nervously watching her.",
        "Everything they spoke of seemed to point toward the murder and the Corpos; if you said, \"It's quite a warm fall,\" you felt that the table was thinking, \"So the M.M.'s can go on marching for a long time yet before snow flies,\" and then you choked and asked sharply for the gravy.",
        "Always Mary was there, a stone statue chilling the warm and commonplace people packed in beside her.",
        "So it came about that David dominated the table talk, for the first delightful time in his nine years of experiment with life, and David liked that very much indeed, and his grandfather liked it not nearly so well.",
        "He chattered, like an entire palm-ful of monkeys, about Foolish, about his new playmates (children of Medary Cole, the miller), about the apparent fact that crocodiles are rarely found in the Beulah River, and the more moving fact that the Rotenstern young had driven with their father clear to Albany.",
        "Now Doremus was fond of children; approved of them; felt with an earnestness uncommon to parents and grandparents that they were human beings and as likely as the next one to become editors.",
        "But he hadn't enough sap of the Christmas holly in his veins to enjoy listening without cessation to the bright prattle of children.",
        "Few males have, outside of Louisa May Alcott.",
        "He thought (though he wasn't very dogmatic about it) that the talk of a Washington correspondent about politics was likely to be more interesting than Davy's remarks on cornflakes and garter snakes, so he went on loving the boy and wishing he would shut up.",
        "And escaped as soon as possible from Mary's gloom and Emma's suffocating thoughtfulness, wherein you felt, every time Emma begged, \"Oh, you must take just a little more of the nice chestnut dressing, Mary dearie,\" that you really ought to burst into tears.",
        "Doremus suspected that Emma was, essentially, more appalled by his having gone to jail than by the murder of her son-in-law.",
        "Jessups simply didn't go to jail.",
        "People who went to jail were bad, just as barn-burners and men accused of that fascinatingly obscure amusement, a \"statutory offense,\" were bad; and as for bad people, you might try to be forgiving and tender, but you didn't sit down to meals with them.",
        "It was all so irregular, and most upsetting to the household routine!",
        "So Emma loved him and worried about him till he wanted to go fishing and actually did go so far as to get out his flies.",
        "But Lorinda had said to him, with eyes brilliant and unworried, \"And I thought you were just a cud-chewing Liberal that didn't mind being milked!",
        "I am so proud of you!",
        "You've encouraged me to fight against—Listen, the minute I heard about your imprisonment I chased Nipper out of my kitchen with a bread knife!...",
        "Well, anyway, I thought about doing it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe office was deader than his home.",
        "The worst of it was that it wasn't so very bad—that, he saw, he could slip into serving the Corpo state with, eventually, no more sense of shame than was felt by old colleagues of his who in pre-Corpo days had written advertisements for fraudulent mouth washes or tasteless cigarettes, or written for supposedly reputable magazines mechanical stories about young love.",
        "In a waking nightmare after his imprisonment, Doremus had pictured Staubmeyer and Ledue in the Informer office standing over him with whips, demanding that he turn out sickening praise for the Corpos, yelling at him until he rose and killed and was killed.",
        "Actually, Shad stayed away from the office, and Doremus's master, Staubmeyer, was ever so friendly and modest and rather nauseatingly full of praise for his craftsmanship.",
        "Staubmeyer seemed satisfied when, instead of the \"apology\" demanded by Swan, Doremus stated that \"Henceforth this paper will cease all criticisms of the present government.\"\r\n\r\nDoremus received from District Commissioner Reek a jolly telegram thanking him for \"gallantly deciding turn your great talent service people and correcting errors doubtless made by us in effort set up new more realistic state.\" Ur!",
        "said Doremus and did not chuck the message at the clothes-basket waste-basket, but carefully walked over and rammed it down amid the trash.",
        "He was able, by remaining with the Informer in her prostitute days, to keep Staubmeyer from discharging Dan Wilgus, who was sniffy to the new boss and unnaturally respectful now to Doremus.",
        "And he invented what he called the \"Yow-yow editorial.\" This was a dirty device of stating as strongly as he could an indictment of Corpoism, then answering it as feebly as he could, as with a whining \"Yow-yow-yow—that's what you say!\" Neither Staubmeyer nor Shad caught him at it, but Doremus hoped fearfully that the shrewd Effingham Swan would never see the Yow-yows.",
        "So week on week he got along not too badly—and there was not one minute when he did not hate this filthy slavery, when he did not have to force himself to stay there, when he did not snarl at himself, \"Then why do you stay?\"\r\n\r\nHis answers to that challenge came glibly and conventionally enough: \"He was too old to start in life again.",
        "And he had a wife and family to support\"—Emma, Sissy, and now Mary and David.",
        "All these years he had heard responsible men who weren't being quite honest—radio announcers who soft-soaped speakers who were fools and wares that were trash, and who canaryishly chirped \"Thank you, Major Blister\" when they would rather have kicked Major Blister, preachers who did not believe the decayed doctrines they dealt out, doctors who did not dare tell lady invalids that they were sex-hungry exhibitionists, merchants who peddled brass for gold—heard all of them complacently excuse themselves by explaining that they were too old to change and that they had \"a wife and family to support.\"\r\n\r\nWhy not let the wife and family die of starvation or get out and hustle for themselves, if by no other means the world could have the chance of being freed from the most boresome, most dull, and foulest disease of having always to be a little dishonest?",
        "So he raged—and went on grinding out a paper dull and a little dishonest—but not forever.",
        "Otherwise the history of Doremus Jessup would be too drearily common to be worth recording.",
        "Again and again, figuring it out on rough sheets of copy paper (adorned also with concentric circles, squares, whorls, and the most improbable fish), he estimated that even without selling the Informer or his house, as under Corpo espionage he certainly could not if he fled to Canada, he could cash in about $20,000.",
        "Say enough to give him an income of a thousand a year—twenty dollars a week, provided he could smuggle the money out of the country, which the Corpos were daily making more difficult.",
        "Well, Emma and Sissy and Mary and he could live on that, in a four-room cottage, and perhaps Sissy and Mary could find work.",
        "But as for himself—\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to talk about men like Thomas Mann and Lion Feuchtwanger and Romain Rolland, who in exile remained writers whose every word was in demand, about Professors Einstein or Salvemini, or, under Corpoism, about the recently exiled or self-exiled Americans, Walt Trowbridge, Mike Gold, William Allen White, John Dos Passos, H.",
        "L.",
        "Mencken, Rexford Tugwell, Oswald Villard.",
        "Nowhere in the world, except possibly in Greenland or Germany, would such stars be unable to find work and soothing respect.",
        "But what was an ordinary newspaper hack, especially if he was over forty-five, to do in a strange land—and more especially if he had a wife named Emma (or Carolina or Nancy or Griselda or anything else) who didn't at all fancy going and living in a sod hut on behalf of honesty and freedom?",
        "So debated Doremus, like some hundreds of thousands of other craftsmen, teachers, lawyers, what-not, in some dozens of countries under a dictatorship, who were aware enough to resent the tyranny, conscientious enough not to take its bribes cynically, yet not so abnormally courageous as to go willingly to exile or dungeon or chopping-block—particularly when they \"had wives and families to support.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDoremus hinted once to Emil Staubmeyer that Emil was \"getting onto the ropes so well\" that he thought of getting out, of quitting newspaper work for good.",
        "The hitherto friendly Mr.",
        "Staubmeyer said sharply, \"What'd you do?",
        "Sneak off to Canada and join the propagandists against the Chief?",
        "Nothing doing!",
        "You'll stay right here and help me—help us!\" And that afternoon Commissioner Shad Ledue shouldered in and grumbled, \"Dr.",
        "Staubmeyer tells me you're doing pretty fairly good work, Jessup, but I want to warn you to keep it up.",
        "Remember that Judge Swan only let you out on parole...",
        "to me!",
        "You can do fine if you just set your mind to it!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you just set your mind to it!\" The one time when the boy Doremus had hated his father had been when he used that condescending phrase.",
        "He saw that, for all the apparent prosaic calm of day after day on the paper, he was equally in danger of slipping into acceptance of his serfdom and of whips and bars if he didn't slip.",
        "And he continued to be just as sick each time he wrote: \"The crowd of fifty thousand people who greeted President Windrip in the university stadium at Iowa City was an impressive sign of the constantly growing interest of all Americans in political affairs,\" and Staubmeyer changed it to: \"The vast and enthusiastic crowd of seventy thousand loyal admirers who wildly applauded and listened to the stirring address of the Chief in the handsome university stadium in beautiful Iowa City, Iowa, is an impressive yet quite typical sign of the growing devotion of all true Americans to political study under the inspiration of the Corpo government.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps his worst irritations were that Staubmeyer had pushed a desk and his sleek, sweaty person into Doremus's private office, once sacred to his solitary grouches, and that Doc Itchitt, hitherto his worshiping disciple, seemed always to be secretly laughing at him.",
        "Under a tyranny, most friends are a liability.",
        "One quarter of them turn \"reasonable\" and become your enemies, one quarter are afraid to stop and speak and one quarter are killed and you die with them.",
        "But the blessed final quarter keep you alive.",
        "When he was with Lorinda, gone was all the pleasant toying and sympathetic talk with which they had relieved boredom.",
        "She was fierce now, and vibrant.",
        "She drew him close enough to her, but instantly she would be thinking of him only as a comrade in plots to kill off the Corpos.",
        "(And it was pretty much a real killing-off that she meant; there wasn't left to view any great amount of her plausible pacifism.)\r\n\r\nShe was busy with good and perilous works.",
        "Partner Nipper had not been able to keep her in the Tavern kitchen; she had so systematized the work that she had many days and evenings free, and she had started a cooking-class for farm girls and young farm wives who, caught between the provincial and the industrial generations, had learned neither good rural cooking with a wood fire, nor yet how to deal with canned goods and electric grills—and who most certainly had not learned how to combine so as to compel the tight- fisted little locally owned power-and-light companies to furnish electricity at tolerable rates.",
        "\"Heavensake, keep this quiet, but I'm getting acquainted with these country gals—getting ready for the day when we begin to organize against the Corpos.",
        "I depend on them, not the well-to-do women that used to want suffrage but that can't endure the thought of revolution,\" Lorinda whispered to him.",
        "\"We've got to do something.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Lorinda B.",
        "Anthony,\" he sighed.",
        "And Karl Pascal stuck.",
        "At Pollikop's garage, when he first saw Doremus after the jailing, he said, \"God, I was sorry to hear about their pinching you, Mr.",
        "Jessup!",
        "But say, aren't you ready to join us Communists now?\" (He looked about anxiously as he said it.)\r\n\r\n\"I thought there weren't any more Bolos.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we're supposed to be wiped out.",
        "But I guess you'll notice a few mysterious strikes starting now and then, even though there can't be any more strikes!",
        "Why aren't you joining us?",
        "There's where you belong, c-comrade!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Karl: you've always said the difference between the Socialists and the Communists was that you believed in complete ownership of all means of production, not just utilities; and that you admitted the violent class war and the Socialists didn't.",
        "That's poppycock!",
        "The real difference is that you Communists serve Russia.",
        "It's your Holy Land.",
        "Well—Russia has all my prayers, right after the prayers for my family and for the Chief, but what I'm interested in civilizing and protecting against its enemies isn't Russia but America.",
        "Is that so banal to say?",
        "Well, it wouldn't be banal for a Russian comrade to observe that he was for Russia!",
        "And America needs our propaganda more every day.",
        "Another thing: I'm a middle-class intellectual.",
        "I'd never call myself any such a damn silly thing, but since you Reds coined it, I'll have to accept it.",
        "That's my class, and that's what I'm interested in.",
        "The proletarians are probably noble fellows, but I certainly do not think that the interests of the middle-class intellectuals and the proletarians are the same.",
        "They want bread.",
        "We want—well, all right, say it, we want cake!",
        "And when you get a proletarian ambitious enough to want cake, too—why, in America, he becomes a middle-class intellectual just as fast as he can—if he can!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, when you think of 3 per cent of the people owning 90 per cent of the wealth—\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think of it!",
        "It does not follow that because a good many of the intellectuals belong to the 97 per cent of the broke—that plenty of actors and teachers and nurses and musicians don't get any better paid than stage hands or electricians, therefore their interests are the same.",
        "It isn't what you earn but how you spend it that fixes your class—whether you prefer bigger funeral services or more books.",
        "I'm tired of apologizing for not having a dirty neck!\"\r\n\r\n\"Honestly, Mr.",
        "Jessup, that's damn nonsense, and you know it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it?",
        "Well, it's my American covered-wagon damn nonsense, and not the propaganda-aeroplane damn nonsense of Marx and Moscow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you'll join us yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Comrade Karl, Windrip and Hitler will join Stalin long before the descendants of Dan'l Webster.",
        "You see, we don't like murder as a way of argument—that's what really marks the Liberal!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout his future Father Perefixe was brief: \"I'm going back to Canada where I belong—away to the freedom of the King.",
        "Hate to give up, Doremus, but I'm no Thomas à Becket, but just a plain, scared, fat little clark!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surprise among old acquaintances was Medary Cole, the miller.",
        "A little younger than Francis Tasbrough and R.",
        "C.",
        "Crowley, less intensely aristocratic than those noblemen, since only one generation separated him from a chin-whiskered Yankee farmer and not two, as with them, he had been their satellite at the Country Club and, as to solid virtue, been president of the Rotary Club.",
        "He had always considered Doremus a man who, without such excuse as being a Jew or a Hunky or poor, was yet flippant about the sanctities of Main Street and Wall Street.",
        "They were neighbors, as Cole's \"Cape Cod cottage\" was just below Pleasant Hill, but they had not by habit been droppers-in.",
        "Now, when Cole came bringing David home, or calling for his daughter Angela, David's new mate, toward supper time of a chilly fall evening, he stopped gratefully for a hot rum punch, and asked Doremus whether he really thought inflation was \"such a good thing.\"\r\n\r\nHe burst out, one evening, \"Jessup, there isn't another person in this town I'd dare say this to, not even my wife, but I'm getting awful sick of having these Minnie Mouses dictate where I have to buy my gunnysacks and what I can pay my men.",
        "I won't pretend I ever cared much for labor unions.",
        "But in those days, at least the union members did get some of the swag.",
        "Now it goes to support the M.M.'s.",
        "We pay them and pay them big to bully us.",
        "It don't look so reasonable as it did in 1936.",
        "But, golly, don't tell anybody I said that!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Cole went off shaking his head, bewildered—he who had ecstatically voted for Mr.",
        "Windrip.",
        "On a day in late October, suddenly striking in every city and village and back-hill hide-out, the Corpos ended all crime in America forever, so titanic a feat that it was mentioned in the London Times.",
        "Seventy thousand selected Minute Men, working in combination with town and state police officers, all under the chiefs of the government secret service, arrested every known or faintly suspected criminal in the country.",
        "They were tried under court-martial procedure; one in ten was shot immediately, four in ten were given prison sentences, three in ten released as innocent...",
        "and two in ten taken into the M.M.'s as inspectors.",
        "There were protests that at least six in ten had been innocent, but this was adequately answered by Windrip's courageous statement: \"The way to stop crime is to stop it!\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, Medary Cole crowed at Doremus, \"Sometimes I've felt like criticizing certain features of Corpo policy, but did you see what the Chief did to the gangsters and racketeers?",
        "Wonderful!",
        "I've told you right along what this country's needed is a firm hand like Windrip's.",
        "No shilly-shallying about that fellow!",
        "He saw that the way to stop crime was to just go out and stop it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen was revealed the New American Education, which, as Sarason so justly said, was to be ever so much newer than the New Educations of Germany, Italy, Poland, or even Turkey.",
        "The authorities abruptly closed some scores of the smaller, more independent colleges such as Williams, Bowdoin, Oberlin, Georgetown, Antioch, Carleton, Lewis Institute, Commonwealth, Princeton, Swarthmore, Kenyon, all vastly different one from another but alike in not yet having entirely become machines.",
        "Few of the state universities were closed; they were merely to be absorbed by central Corpo universities, one in each of the eight provinces.",
        "But the government began with only two.",
        "In the Metropolitan District, Windrip University took over the Rockefeller Center and Empire State buildings, with most of Central Park for playground (excluding the general public from it entirely, for the rest was an M.M.",
        "drill ground).",
        "The second was Macgoblin University, in Chicago and vicinity, using the buildings of Chicago and Northwestern universities, and Jackson Park.",
        "President Hutchins of Chicago was rather unpleasant about the whole thing and declined to stay on as an assistant professor, so the authorities had politely to exile him.",
        "Tattle-mongers suggested that the naming of the Chicago plant after Macgoblin instead of Sarason suggested a beginning coolness between Sarason and Windrip, but the two leaders were able to quash such canards by appearing together at the great reception given to Bishop Cannon by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and being photographed shaking hands.",
        "Each of the two pioneer universities started with an enrollment of fifty thousand, making ridiculous the pre-Corpo schools, none of which, in 1935, had had more than thirty thousand students.",
        "The enrollment was probably helped by the fact that anyone could enter upon presenting a certificate showing that he had completed two years in a high school or business college, and a recommendation from a Corpo commissioner.",
        "Dr.",
        "Macgoblin pointed out that this founding of entirely new universities showed the enormous cultural superiority of the Corpo state to the Nazis, Bolsheviks, and Fascists.",
        "Where these amateurs in re-civilization had merely kicked out all treacherous so-called \"intellectual\" teachers who mulishly declined to teach physics, cookery, and geography according to the principles and facts laid down by the political bureaus, and the Nazis had merely added the sound measure of discharging Jews who dared attempt to teach medicine, the Americans were the first to start new and completely orthodox institutions, free from the very first of any taint of \"intellectualism.\"\r\n\r\nAll Corpo universities were to have the same curriculum, entirely practical and modern, free of all snobbish tradition.",
        "Entirely omitted were Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Hebrew, Biblical study, archaeology, philology; all history before 1500—except for one course which showed that, through the centuries, the key to civilization had been the defense of Anglo-Saxon purity against barbarians.",
        "Philosophy and its history, psychology, economics, anthropology were retained, but, to avoid the superstitious errors in ordinary textbooks, they were to be conned only in new books prepared by able young scholars under the direction of Dr.",
        "Macgoblin.",
        "Students were encouraged to read, speak, and try to write modern languages, but they were not to waste their time on the so-called \"literature\"; reprints from recent newspapers were used instead of antiquated fiction and sentimental poetry.",
        "As regards English, some study of literature was permitted, to supply quotations for political speeches, but the chief courses were in advertising, party journalism, and business correspondence, and no authors before 1800 might be mentioned, except Shakespeare and Milton.",
        "In the realm of so-called \"pure science,\" it was realized that only too much and too confusing research had already been done, but no pre-Corpo university had ever shown such a wealth of courses in mining engineering, lakeshore-cottage architecture, modern foremanship and production methods, exhibition gymnastics, the higher accountancy, therapeutics of athlete's foot, canning and fruit dehydration, kindergarten training, organization of chess, checkers, and bridge tournaments, cultivation of will power, band music for mass meetings, schnauzer-breeding, stainless-steel formulæ, cement-road construction, and all other really useful subjects for the formation of the new-world mind and character.",
        "And no scholastic institution, even West Point, had ever so richly recognized sport as not a subsidiary but a primary department of scholarship.",
        "All the more familiar games were earnestly taught, and to them were added the most absorbing speed contests in infantry drill, aviation, bombing, and operation of tanks, armored cars, and machine guns.",
        "All of these carried academic credits, though students were urged not to elect sports for more than one third of their credits.",
        "What really showed the difference from old-fogy inefficiency was that with the educational speed-up of the Corpo universities, any bright lad could graduate in two years.",
        "As he read the prospectuses for these Olympian, these Ringling-Barnum and Bailey universities, Doremus remembered that Victor Loveland, who a year ago had taught Greek in a little college called Isaiah, was now grinding out reading and arithmetic in a Corpo labor camp in Maine.",
        "Oh well, Isaiah itself had been closed, and its former president, Dr.",
        "Owen J.",
        "Peaseley, District Director of Education, was to be right-hand man to Professor Almeric Trout when they founded the University of the Northeastern Province, which was to supplant Harvard, Radcliffe, Boston University, and Brown.",
        "He was already working on the university yell, and for that \"project\" had sent out letters to 167 of the more prominent poets in America, asking for suggestions.",
        "CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nIT was not only the November sleet, setting up a forbidding curtain before the mountains, turning the roadways into slipperiness on which a car would swing around and crash into poles, that kept Doremus stubbornly at home that morning, sitting on his shoulder blades before the fireplace.",

        "He cursed, threw down the New York Daily Corporate, and tried to read a new novel about a lady whose husband was indelicate in bed and who was too absorbed by the novels he wrote about lady novelists whose husbands were too absorbed by the novels they wrote about lady novelists to appreciate the fine sensibilities of lady novelists who wrote about gentleman novelists—Anyway, he chucked the book after the newspaper.",

        "His birthday in 1937 he commemorated by the historical \"Order of Regulation,\" which stated that though the Corporate government had proved both its stability and its good-will, there were still certain stupid or vicious \"elements\" who, in their foul envy of Corpo success, wanted to destroy everything that was good.",

        "On the eleventh, a concentration camp was enthusiastically opened, with band music, paper flowers, and speeches by District Commissioner Reek and Shad Ledue, at Trianon, nine miles north of Fort Beulah, in what had been a modern experimental school for girls.",

        "Ordinarily, since it was none of the public's business anyway, the M.M.'s did not give out details of their disciplining of rebels, but in this case, where the fool of a dentist had shown himself to be a homicidal maniac, the local M.M.",

        "But in New York City the case was the opposite—instead of being thus surprised, the M.M.'s rounded up all suspected Communists in the former boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx, and all persons who were reported to have been seen consorting with such Communists, and interned the lot of them in the nineteen concentration camps on Long Island....",

        "People who could not resist talking politics spoke of Windrip as \"Colonel Robinson\" or \"Dr.",

        "The real enemies were men whose sanctification by death had appallingly permitted them to sneak even into respectable school libraries—men so perverse that they had been traitors to the Corpo State years and years before there had been any Corpo State; and Swan (with Peaseley chirping agreement) barred from all sale or possession the books of Thoreau, Emerson, Whittier, Whitman, Mark Twain, Howells, and The New Freedom, by Woodrow Wilson, for though in later life Wilson became a sound manipulative politician, he had earlier been troubled with itching ideals.",

        "The fire was almost over when Karl Pascal pushed up to Shad Ledue and shouted, \"I hear you stinkers—I've been out driving a guy, and I hear you raided my room and took off my books while I was away!\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet we did, Comrade!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you're burning them—burning my—\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, Comrade!",
        "Not burning 'em.",

        "Brayden went to concentration camp.",

        "I asked a very prominent Hebrew banker about the assertions that his people were being oppressed, and he assured me, 'When we hear about such silly rumors, we are highly amused.'\"\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nDOREMUS was nervous.",

        "Emil avoided him at the office.",
        "Doremus was called to Shad's office and gruffly questioned about correspondence which some denouncer had reported his having with the agents of Walt Trowbridge.",

        "The fruitman, Tony Mogliani, flowery advocate of Windrip, of Mussolini, and of tobacco quid as a cure for cuts and burns, asked him too many questions about his plans for the time when he should \"get through on the paper\"; and once a tramp tried to quiz Mrs.",

        "But I'm not going to let a bunch of lunatics and gunmen drive me out of the country that I and my ancestors made!\"\r\n\r\nEmma choked with the effort to think of something convincing; Mary seemed without tears to be weeping; Sissy squeaked; Julian and Lorinda started to speak and interrupted each other; and it was the uninvited Mrs.",

        "We'll start tomorrow night.\" What he did not say was that he planned, the moment he had his family safe in Canada, with money in the bank and perhaps a job to amuse Sissy, to run away from them and come back to his proper fight.",
        "He would at least kill Shad before he got killed himself.",
        "It was only a week before Christmas, a holiday always greeted with good cheer and quantities of colored ribbons in the Jessup household; and that wild day of preparing for flight had a queer Christmas joyfulness.",
        "To dodge suspicion, Doremus spent most of the time at the office, and a hundred times it seemed that Staubmeyer was glancing at him with just the ruler-threatening hidden ire he had used on whisperers and like young criminals in school.",
        "But he took off two hours at lunch time, and he went home early in the afternoon, and his long depression was gone in the prospect of Canada and freedom, in an excited inspection of clothes that was like preparation for a fishing trip.",

        "Candy was pretentiously busy looking normal—after their flight, she and the canary were to remain and she was to be surprised when the M.M.'s reported that the Jessups seemed to have escaped.",
        "Doremus had drawn five hundred from each of the local banks, late that afternoon, telling them that he was thinking of taking an option on an apple orchard.",
        "He was too well-trained a domestic animal to be raucously amused, but he could not help observing that while he himself was taking on the flight to Egypt only all the money he could get hold of, plus cigarettes, six handkerchiefs, two extra pairs of socks, a comb, a toothbrush, and the first volume of Spengler's Decline of the West—decidedly it was not his favorite book, but one he had been trying to make himself read for years, on train journeys—while, in fact, he took nothing that he could not stuff into his overcoat pockets, Sissy apparently had need of all her newest lingerie and of a large framed picture of Julian, Emma of a kodak album showing the three children from the ages of one to twenty, David of his new model aeroplane, and Mary of her still, dark hatred that was heavier to carry than many chests.",
        "Julian and Lorinda were there to help them; Julian off in corners with Sissy.",
        "With Lorinda, Doremus had but one free moment...",

        "Join Trowbridge!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but to leave you—I'd hoped somehow, by some miracle, you and I could have maybe a month together, say in Monterey or Venice or the Yellowstone.",
        "I hate it when life doesn't seem to stick together and get somewhere and have some plan and meaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's had meaning!",
        "No dictator can completely smother us now!",
        "Come!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, my Linda!\"\r\n\r\nNot even now did he alarm her by confessing that he planned to come back, into danger.",
        "Embracing beside an aged tin-lined bathtub with woodwork painted a dreary brown, in a room which smelled slightly of gas from an old hot-water heater—embracing in sunset-colored mist upon a mountain top.",
        "Darkness, edged wind, wickedly deliberate snow, and in it Buck Titus boisterously cheerful in his veteran Nash, looking as farmer-like as he could, in sealskin cap with rubbed bare patches and an atrocious dogskin overcoat.",
        "Doremus thought of him again as a Captain Charles King cavalryman chasing the Sioux across blizzard-blinded prairies.",
        "They packed alarmingly into the car; Mary beside Buck, the driver; in the back, Doremus between Emma and Sissy; on the floor, David and Foolish and the toy aeroplane indistinguishably curled up together beneath a robe.",
        "Trunk rack and front fenders were heaped with tarpaulin-covered suitcases.",
        "\"Lord, I wish I were going!\" moaned Julian.",
        "\"Look!",
        "Sis!",
        "Grand spy-story idea!",
        "But I mean seriously: Send souvenir postcards to my granddad—views of churches and so on—just sign 'em 'Jane'—and whatever you say about the church, I'll know you really mean it about you and—Oh, damn all mystery!",
        "I want you, Sissy!\"\r\n\r\nMrs.",
        "Candy whisked a bundle in among the already intolerable mess of baggage which promised to descend on Doremus's knees and David's head, and she snapped, \"Well, if you folks must go flyin' around the country—It's a cocoanut layer cake.\" Savagely: \"Soon's you get around the corner, throw the fool thing in the ditch if you want to!\" She fled sobbing into the kitchen, where Lorinda stood in the lighted doorway, silent, her trembling hands out to them.",
        "The car was already lurching in the snow before they had sneaked through Fort Beulah by shadowy back-streets and started streaking northward.",
        "Sissy sang out cheerily, \"Well, Christmas in Canada!",
        "Skittles and beer and lots of holly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do they have Santa Claus in Canada?\" came David's voice, wondering, childish, slightly muffled by lap robe and the furry ears of Foolish.",
        "\"Of course they do, dearie!\" Emma reassured him and, to the grown-ups, \"Now wasn't that the cutest thing!\"\r\n\r\nTo Doremus, Sissy whispered, \"Darn well ought to be cute.",
        "Took me ten minutes to teach him to say it, this afternoon!",
        "Hold my hand.",
        "I hope Buck knows how to drive!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBuck Titus knew every back-road from Fort Beulah to the border, preferably in filthy weather, like tonight.",
        "Beyond Trianon he pulled the car up deep-rutted roads, on which you would have to back if you were to pass anyone.",
        "Up grades on which the car knocked and panted, into lonely hills, by a zigzag of roads, they jerked toward Canada.",
        "Wet snow sheathed the windshield, then froze, and Buck had to drive with his head thrust out through the open window, and the blast came in and circled round their stiff necks.",
        "Doremus could see nothing save the back of Buck's twisted, taut neck, and the icy windshield, most of the time.",
        "Just now and then a light far below the level of the road indicated that they were sliding along a shelf road, and if they skidded off, they would keep going a hundred feet, two hundred feet, downward—probably turning over and over.",
        "Once they did skid, and while they panted in an eternity of four seconds, Buck yanked the car up a bank beside the road, down to the left again, and finally straight— speeding on as if nothing had happened, while Doremus felt feeble in the knees.",
        "For a long while he kept going rigid with fear, but he sank into misery, too cold and deaf to feel anything except a slow desire to vomit as the car lurched.",
        "Probably he slept—at least, he awakened, and awakened to a sensation of pushing the car anxiously up hill, as she bucked and stuttered in the effort to make a slippery rise.",
        "Suppose the engine died—suppose the brakes would not hold and they slid back downhill, reeling, bursting off the road and down—A great many suppositions tortured him, hour by hour.",
        "Then he tried being awake and bright and helpful.",
        "He noticed that the ice-lined windshield, illuminated from the light on the snow ahead, was a sheet of diamonds.",
        "He noticed it, but he couldn't get himself to think much of diamonds, even in sheets.",
        "He tried conversation.",
        "\"Cheer up.",
        "Breakfast at dawn—across the border!\" he tried on Sissy.",
        "\"Breakfast!\" she said bitterly.",
        "And they crunched on, in that moving coffin with only the sheet of diamonds and Buck's silhouette alive in all the world.",
        "After unnumbered hours the car reared and tumbled and reared again.",
        "The motor raced; its sound rose to an intolerable roaring; yet the car seemed not to be moving.",
        "The motor stopped abruptly.",
        "Buck cursed, popped his head back into the car like a turtle, and the starter ground long and whiningly.",
        "The motor again roared, again stopped.",
        "They could hear stiff branches rattling, hear Foolish moaning in sleep.",
        "The car was a storm-menaced cabin in the wilderness.",
        "The silence seemed waiting, as they were waiting.",
        "\"Strouble?\" said Doremus.",
        "\"Stuck.",
        "No traction.",
        "Hit a drift of wet snow—drainage from a busted culvert, I sh' think.",
        "Hell!",
        "Have to get out and take a look.\"\r\n\r\nOutside the car, as Doremus crept down from the slippery running-board, it was cold in a vicious wind.",
        "He was so stiff he could scarcely stand.",
        "As people do, feeling important and advisory, Doremus looked at the drift with an electric torch, and Sissy looked at the drift with the torch, and Buck impatiently took the torch away from them and looked twice.",
        "\"Get some—\" and \"Brush would help,\" said Sissy and Buck together, while Doremus rubbed his chilly ears.",
        "They three trotted back and forth with fragments of brush, laying it in front of the wheels, while Mary politely asked from within, \"Can I help?\" and no one seemed particularly to have answered her.",
        "The headlights picked out an abandoned shack beside the road; an unpainted gray pine cabin with broken window glass and no door.",
        "Emma, sighing her way out of the car and stepping through the lumpy snow as delicately as a pacer at a horse show, said humbly, \"That little house there—maybe I could go in and make some hot coffee on the alcohol stove—didn't have room for a thermos.",
        "Hot coffee, Dormouse?\"\r\n\r\nTo Doremus she sounded, just now, not at all like a wife, but as sensible as Mrs.",
        "Candy.",
        "When the car did kick its way up on the pathway of twigs and stand panting safely beyond the drift, they had, in the sheltered shack, coffee with slabs of Mrs.",
        "Candy's voluptuous cocoanut cake.",
        "Doremus pondered, \"This is a nice place.",
        "I like this place.",
        "It doesn't bounce or skid.",
        "I don't want to leave this place.\"\r\n\r\nHe did.",
        "The secure immobility of the shack was behind them, dark miles behind, and they were again pitching and rolling and being sick and inescapably chilly.",
        "David was alternately crying and going back to sleep.",
        "Foolish woke up to cough inquiringly and returned to his dream of rabbiting.",
        "And Doremus was sleeping, his head swaying like a masthead in long rollers, his shoulder against Emma's, his hand warm about Sissy's, and his soul in nameless bliss.",
        "He roused to a half-dawn filmy with snow.",
        "The car was standing in what seemed to be a crossroads hamlet, and Buck was examining a map by the light of the electric torch.",
        "\"Got anywhere yet?\" Doremus whispered.",
        "\"Just a few miles to the border.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anybody stopped us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope.",
        "Oh, we'll make it, all right, o' man.\"\r\n\r\nOut of East Berkshire, Buck took not the main road to the border but an old wood lane so little used that the ruts were twin snakes.",
        "Though Doremus said nothing, the others felt his intensity, his anxiety that was like listening for an enemy in the dark.",
        "David sat up, the blue motor robe about him.",
        "Foolish started, snorted, looked offended but, catching the spirit of the moment, comfortingly laid a paw on Doremus's knee and insisted on shaking hands, over and over, as gravely as a Venetian senator or an undertaker.",
        "They dropped into the dimness of a tree-walled hollow.",
        "A searchlight darted, and rested hotly on them, so dazzling them that Buck almost ran off the road.",
        "\"Confound it,\" he said gently.",
        "No one else said anything.",
        "He crawled up to the light, which was mounted on a platform in front of a small shelter hut.",
        "Two Minute Men stood out in the road, dripping with radiance from the car.",
        "They were young and rural, but they had efficient repeating rifles.",
        "\"Where you headed for?\" demanded the elder, good-naturedly enough.",
        "\"Montreal, where we live.\" Buck showed his Canadian license....",
        "Gasoline motor and electric light, yet Doremus saw the frontier guard as a sentry in 1864, studying a pass by lantern light, beside a farm wagon in which hid General Joe Johnston's spies disguised as plantation hands.",
        "\"I guess it's all right.",
        "Seems in order.",
        "But we've had some trouble with refugees.",
        "You'll have to wait till the Battalion-Leader comes—maybe 'long about noon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But good Lord, Inspector, we can't do that!",
        "My mother's awful sick, in Montreal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yuh, I've heard that one before!",
        "And maybe it's true, this time.",
        "But afraid you'll have to wait for the Bat.",
        "You folks can come in and set by the fire, if you want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we've got to—\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard what I said!\" The M.M.'s were fingering their rifles.",
        "\"All right.",
        "But tell you what we'll do.",
        "We'll go back to East Berkshire and get some breakfast and a wash and come back here.",
        "Noon, you said?\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay!",
        "And say, Brother, it does seem kind of funny, your taking this back road, when there's a first-rate highway.",
        "S' long.",
        "Be good....",
        "Just don't try it again!",
        "The Bat might be here next time—and he ain't a farmer like you or me!\"\r\n\r\nThe refugees, as they drove away, had an uncomfortable feeling that the guards were laughing at them.",
        "Three border posts they tried, and at three posts they were turned back.",
        "\"Well?\" said Buck.",
        "\"Yes.",
        "I guess so.",
        "Back home.",
        "My turn to drive,\" said Doremus wearily.",
        "The humiliation of retreat was the worse in that none of the guards had troubled to do more than laugh at them.",
        "They were trapped too tightly for the trappers to worry.",
        "Doremus's only clear emotion as, tails between their legs, they back-tracked to Shad Ledue's sneer and to Mrs.",
        "Candy's \"Well, I never!\" was regret that he had not shot one guard, at least, and he raged:\r\n\r\n\"Now I know why men like John Brown became crazy killers!\"\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nHE could not decide whether Emil Staubmeyer, and through him Shad Ledue, knew that he had tried to escape.",
        "Did Staubmeyer really look more knowing, or did he just imagine it?",
        "What the deuce had Emil meant when he said, \"I hear the roads aren't so good up north— not so good!\" Whether they knew or not, it was grinding that he should have to shiver lest an illiterate roustabout like Shad Ledue find out that he desired to go to Canada, while a ruler-slapper like Staubmeyer, a Squeers with certificates in \"pedagogy,\" should now be able to cuff grown men instead of urchins and should be editor of the Informer!",
        "Doremus's Informer!",
        "Staubmeyer!",
        "That human blackboard!",
        "Daily Doremus found it more cramping, more instantly stirring to fury, to write anything mentioning Windrip.",
        "His private office— the cheerfully rattling linotype room—the shouting pressroom with its smell of ink that to him hitherto had been like the smell of grease paint to an actor—they were hateful now, and choking.",
        "Not even Lorinda's faith, not even Sissy's jibes and Buck's stories, could rouse him to hope.",
        "He rejoiced the more, therefore, when his son Philip telephoned him from Worcester: \"Be home Sunday?",
        "Merilla's in New York, gadding, and I'm all alone here.",
        "Thought I'd just drive up for the day and see how things are in your neck of the woods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on!",
        "Splendid!",
        "So long since we've seen you.",
        "I'll have your mother start a pot of beans right away!\"\r\n\r\nDoremus was happy.",
        "Not for some time did his cursed two-way-mindedness come to weaken his joy, as he wondered whether it wasn't just a myth held over from boyhood that Philip really cared so much for Emma's beans and brown bread; and wondered just why it was that Up-to-Date Americans like Philip always used the long-distance telephone rather than undergo the dreadful toil of dictating a letter a day or two earlier.",
        "It didn't really seem so efficient, the old-fashioned village editor reflected, to spend seventy-five cents on a telephone call in order to save five cents' worth of time.",
        "\"Oh hush!",
        "Anyway, I'll be delighted to see the boy!",
        "I'll bet there isn't a smarter young lawyer in Worcester.",
        "There's one member of the family that's a real success!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a little shocked when Philip came, like a one-man procession, into the living room, late on Saturday afternoon.",
        "He had been forgetting how bald this upstanding young advocate was growing even at thirty-four.",
        "And it seemed to him that Philip was a little heavy and senatorial in speech and a bit too cordial.",
        "\"By Jove, Dad, you don't know how good it is to be back in the old digs.",
        "Mother and the girls upstairs?",
        "By Jove, sir, that was a horrible business, the killing of poor Fowler.",
        "Horrible!",
        "I was simply horrified.",
        "There must have been a mistake somewhere, because Judge Swan has a wonderful reputation for scrupulousness.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no mistake.",
        "Swan is a fiend.",

        "\"Really?",
        "We must talk it over.",
        "I'll see if there can't be a stricter investigation.",
        "Swan?",
        "Really!",
        "We'll certainly go into the whole business.",
        "But first I must just skip upstairs and give Mammy a good smack, and Mary and Little Sis.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was the last time that Philip mentioned Effingham Swan or any \"stricter investigation\" of the acts thereof.",
        "All afternoon he was relentlessly filial and fraternal, and he smiled like an automobile salesman when Sissy griped at him, \"What's the idea of all the tender hand-dusting, Philco?\"\r\n\r\nDoremus and he were not alone till nearly midnight.",
        "They sat upstairs in the sacred study.",
        "Philip lighted one of Doremus's excellent cigars as though he were a cinema actor playing the role of a man lighting an excellent cigar, and breathed amiably:\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, this is an excellent cigar!",
        "It certainly is excellent!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I just mean—I was just appreciating it—\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Phil?",
        "There's something on your mind.",
        "Shoot!",
        "Not rowing with Merilla, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not!",
        "Most certainly not!",
        "Oh, I don't approve of everything Merry does—she's a little extravagant—but she's got a heart of gold, and let me tell you, Pater, there isn't a young society woman in Worcester that makes a nicer impression on everybody, especially at nice dinner parties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then?",
        "Let's have it, Phil.",
        "Something serious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye-es, I'm afraid there is.",
        "Look, Dad....",
        "Oh, do sit down and be comfortable!...",
        "I've been awfully perturbed to hear that you've, uh, that you're in slightly bad odor with some of the authorities.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the Corpos?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally!",
        "Who else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I don't recognize 'em as authorities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, listen, Pater, please don't joke tonight!",
        "I'm serious.",
        "As a matter fact, I hear you're more than just 'slightly' in wrong with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who may your informant be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, just letters—old school friends.",
        "Now you aren't really pro- Corpo, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you ever guess?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've been—I didn't vote for Windrip, personally, but I begin to see where I was wrong.",
        "I can see now that he has not only great personal magnetism, but real constructive power—real sure-enough statesmanship.",
        "Some say it's Lee Sarason's doing, but don't you believe it for a minute.",
        "Look at all Buzz did back in his home state, before he ever teamed up with Sarason!",
        "And some say Windrip is crude.",
        "Well, so were Lincoln and Jackson.",
        "Now what I think of Windrip—\"\r\n\r\n\"The only thing you ought to think of Windrip is that his gangsters murdered your fine brother-in-law!",
        "And plenty of other men just as good.",
        "Do you condone such murders?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!",
        "Certainly not!",

        "Still, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs—\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell and damnation!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Pater!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't call me 'Pater'!",
        "If I ever hear that 'can't make an omelet' phrase again, I'll start doing a little murder myself!",

        "I guess maybe the phrase is a little shopworn!",
        "I just mean to say—I'm just trying to figure this situation out realistically!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Realistically'!",
        "That's another buttered bun to excuse murder!\"\r\n\r\n\"But honestly, you know—horrible things do happen, thanks to the imperfection of human nature, but you can forgive the means if the end is a rejuvenated nation that—\"\r\n\r\n\"I can do nothing of the kind!",
        "I can never forgive evil and lying and cruel means, and still less can I forgive fanatics that use that for an excuse!",
        "If I may imitate Romain Rolland, a country that tolerates evil means—evil manners, standards of ethics—for a generation, will be so poisoned that it never will have any good end.",
        "I'm just curious, but do you know how perfectly you're quoting every Bolshevik apologist that sneers at decency and kindness and truthfulness in daily dealings as 'bourgeois morality'?",
        "I hadn't understood that you'd gone quite so Marxo- materialistic!\"\r\n\r\n\"I!",
        "Marxian!",
        "Good God!\" Doremus was pleased to see that he had stirred his son out of his if-your-honor-please smugness.",
        "\"Why, one of the things I most admire about the Corpos is that, as I know, absolutely—I have reliable information from Washington—they have saved us from a simply ghastly invasion by red agents of Moscow—Communists pretending to be decent labor-leaders!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not really!\" (Had the fool forgotten that his father was a newspaperman and not likely to be impressed by \"reliable information from Washington\"?)\r\n\r\n\"Really!",

        "Had he been wise, after all, to restrain himself from the domestic pleasure of licking the brat?)\r\n\r\n\"The whole point is that Windrip, or anyway the Corpos, are here to stay, Pater, and we've got to base our future actions not on some desired Utopia but on what we really and truly have.",
        "And think of what they've actually done!",
        "Just, for example, how they've removed the advertising billboards from the highways, and ended unemployment, and their simply stupendous feat in getting rid of all crime!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me—what y' say, Dad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!",
        "Nothing!",
        "Go on!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I begin to see now that the Corpo gains haven't been just material but spiritual.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really!",

        "Kind of lost the sturdiness that characterized our pioneer ancestors.",
        "Why, ever so many young men were refusing to take military drill, and the discipline and will power and good-fellowship that you only get from military training—Oh, pardon me!",
        "I forgot you were a pacifist.\"\r\n\r\nDoremus grimly muttered, \"Not any more!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course there must be any number of things we can't agree on, Dad.",
        "But after all, as a publicist you ought to listen to the Voice of Youth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You?",

        "Staubmeyer was patronizing, Doc Itchitt looked quizzical, but the chapel, headed by Dan Wilgus, shook hands profusely.",
        "And so, at sixty-two, stronger and more eager than he had been in all his life, Doremus had nothing to do more important than eating breakfast and telling his grandson stories about the elephant.",
        "But that lasted less than a week.",
        "Avoiding suspicion from Emma and Sissy and even from Buck and Lorinda, he took Julian aside:\r\n\r\n\"Look here, boy.",
        "I think it's time now for me to begin doing a little high treason.",
        "(Heaven's sake keep all of this under your hat—don't even tip off Sissy!) I guess you know, the Communists are too theocratic for my tastes.",
        "But looks to me as though they have more courage and devotion and smart strategy than anybody since the Early Christian Martyrs—whom they also resemble in hairiness and a fondness for catacombs.",
        "I want to get in touch with 'em and see if there's any dirty work at the crossroads I can do for 'em—say distributing a few Early Christian tracts by St.",
        "Lenin.",
        "But of course, theoretically, the Communists have all been imprisoned.",
        "Could you get to Karl Pascal, in Trianon, and find out whom I could see?\"\r\n\r\nSaid Julian, \"I think I could.",
        "Dr.",
        "Olmsted gets called in there sometimes on cases—they hate him, because he hates them, but still, their camp doctor is a drunken bum, and they have to have a real doc in when one of their warders busts his wrist beating up some prisoner.",
        "I'll try, sir.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days afterward Julian returned.",
        "\"My God, what a sewer that Trianon place is!",
        "I'd waited for Olmsted before, in the car, but I never had the nerve to butt inside.",
        "The buildings—they were nice buildings, quite pretty, when the girls' school had them.",
        "Now the fittings are all torn out, and they've put up wallboard partitions for cells, and the whole place stinks of carbolic acid and excrement, and the air— there isn't any—you feel as if you were nailed up in a box—I don't know how anybody lives in one of those cells for an hour—and yet there's six men bunked in a cell twelve feet by ten, with a ceiling only seven feet high, and no light except a twenty-five watt, I guess it is, bulb in the ceiling—you couldn't read by it.",
        "But they get out for exercise two hours a day—walk around and around the courtyard—they're all so stooped, and they all look so ashamed, as if they'd had the defiance just licked out of 'em—even Karl a little, and you remember how proud and sort of sardonic he was.",
        "Well, I got to see him, and he says to get in touch with this man—here, I wrote it down—and for God's sake, burn it up soon as you've memorized it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he—had they—?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, they've beaten him, all right.",
        "He wouldn't talk about it.",
        "But there was a scar right across his cheek, from his temple right down to his chin.",
        "And I had just a glimpse of Henry Veeder.",
        "Remember how he looked—like an oak tree?",
        "Now he twitches all the time, and jumps and gasps when he hears a sudden sound.",
        "He didn't know me.",
        "I don't think he'd know anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDoremus announced to his family and told it loudly in Gath that he was still looking for an option on an apple orchard to which they might retire, and he journeyed southward, with pajamas and a toothbrush and the first volume of Spengler's Decline of the West in a briefcase.",
        "The address given by Karl Pascal was that of a most gentlemanly dealer in altar cloths and priestly robes, who had his shop and office over a tea room in Hartford, Connecticut.",
        "He talked about the cembalo and the spinetta di serenata and the music of Palestrina for an hour before he sent Doremus on to a busy engineer constructing a dam in New Hampshire, who sent him to a tailor in a side-street shop in Lynn, who at last sent him to northern Connecticut and to the Eastern headquarters of what was left of the Communists in America.",
        "Still carrying his little briefcase he walked up a greasy hill, impassable to any motorcar, and knocked at the faded green door of a squat New England farm cottage masked in wintry old lilac bushes and spiræa shrubs.",

        "Yes!",
        "He'd get what he could for the house and for what small share in Informer stock the government had left him when they had taken it over, and go—well, just go—the Rockies or anywhere that was new.",
        "But he realized that Emma did not at all wish to go new places; and realized that the Emma to whose billowy warmth it had been comforting to come home after the office, bored him and was bored by him when he was always there.",
        "The only difference was that she did not seem capable of admitting that one might, without actual fiendishness or any signs of hot-footing it for Reno, be bored by one's faithful spouse.",
        "\"Why don't you drive out and see Buck or Lorinda?\" she suggested.",
        "\"Don't you ever get a little jealous of my girl, Linda?\" he said, very lightly—because he very heavily wanted to know.",

        "\"You?",
        "At your age?",
        "As if anybody thought you could be a lover!\"\r\n\r\nWell, Lorinda thought so, he raged, and promptly he did \"drive out and see her,\" a little easier in mind about his divided loyalties.",
        "Only once did he go back to the Informer office.",
        "Staubmeyer was not in sight, and it was evident that the real editor was that sly bumpkin, Doc Itchitt, who didn't even rise at Doremus's entrance nor listen when Doremus gave his opinion of the new make-up of the rural-correspondence pages.",
        "That was an apostasy harder to endure than Shad Ledue's, for Shad had always been rustically certain that Doremus was a fool, almost as bad as real \"city folks,\" while Doc Itchitt had once appreciated the tight joints and smooth surfaces and sturdy bases of Doremus's craftsmanship.",
        "Day on day he waited.",
        "So much of a revolution for so many people is nothing but waiting.",
        "That is one reason why tourists rarely see anything but contentment in a crushed population.",

        "I wonder if I can interest you in a wonnerful new form of life-insurance policy.",
        "Wonnerful!\" But he didn't sound as though he himself thought it was very wonnerful.",
        "He was a pest.",
        "He was always dragging himself into some unwelcoming shop, and yet he seemed to sell few policies, if any.",
        "Not for two days did Doremus perceive that Mr.",
        "Dimick of Albany managed to meet him an astonishing number of times a day.",
        "As he came out of the Wessex, he saw Mr.",
        "Dimick leaning against a lamppost, ostentatiously not looking his way, yet three minutes later and two blocks away, Mr.",
        "Dimick trailed after him into the Vert Mont Pool & Tobacco Headquarters, and listened to Doremus's conversation with Tom Aiken about fish hatcheries.",
        "Doremus was suddenly cold.",
        "He made it a point to sneak uptown that evening and saw Mr.",
        "Dimick talking to the driver of a Beulah-Montpelier bus with an intensity that wasn't in the least gray.",
        "Doremus glared.",
        "Mr.",
        "Dimick looked at him with watery eyes, croaked, \"Devenin', Mr.",
        "D'remus; like t' talk t' you about insurance some time when you got the time,\" and shuffled away.",
        "Later, Doremus took out and cleaned his revolver, said, \"Oh, rats!\" and put it away.",
        "He heard a ring as he did so, and went downstairs to find Mr.",
        "Dimick sitting on the oak hat rack in the hall, rubbing his hat.",
        "\"I'd like to talk to you, if y'ain't too busy,\" whined Mr.",

        "Got to hustle.",
        "I'm from Walt Trowbridge.",

        "You're going to be one of us!",
        "Now phone!\"\r\n\r\nDoremus telephoned to Samson: \"Say, Ed, is a fellow named Dimick, kind of weedy-looking, pop-eyed fellow, all right?",
        "Shall I take his advice on insurance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.",

        "Dan Wilgus, the foreman, remained after the others had gone, setting a Minute Man poster which announced that there would be a grand parade on March ninth, and incidentally that President Windrip was defying the world.",
        "Dan stopped, looked sharply about, and tramped into the storeroom.",
        "In the light from a dusty electric bulb the place was like a tomb of dead news, with ancient red-and-black posters of Scotland county fairs and proofs of indecent limericks pasted on the walls.",
        "From a case of eight-point, once used for the setting of pamphlets but superseded by a monotype machine, Dan picked out bits of type from each of several compartments, wrapped them in scraps of print paper, and stored them in the pocket of his jacket.",
        "The raped type boxes looked only half filled, and to make up for it he did something that should have shocked any decent printer even if he were on strike.",
        "He filled them up with type not from another eight-point case, but with old ten-point.",
        "Daniel, the large and hairy, thriftily pinching the tiny types, was absurd as an elephant playing at being a hen.",
        "He turned out the lights on the third floor and clumped downstairs.",
        "He glanced in at the editorial rooms.",
        "No one was there save Doc Itchitt, in a small circle of light that through the visor of his eye shade cast a green tint on his unwholesome face.",
        "He was correcting an article by the titular editor, Ensign Emil Staubmeyer, and he snickered as he carved it with a large black pencil.",
        "He raised his head, startled.",
        "\"Hello, Doc.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Dan.",
        "Staying late?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yuh.",

        "Oh yes, I ran into him at the Rexall store, couple days ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still as sour as ever about the régime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he didn't say anything.",
        "Darned old fool!",
        "Even if he don't like all the brave boys in uniform, he ought to see the Chief is here for keeps, by golly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly ought to!",
        "And it's a swell régime.",
        "Fellow can get ahead in newspaper work now, and not be held back by a bunch of snobs that think they're so doggone educated just because they went to college!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right.",
        "Well, hell with Jessup and all the old stiffs.",
        "G'night, Doc!\"\r\n\r\nDan and Brother Itchitt unsmilingly gave the M.M.",
        "salute, arms held out.",
        "Dan thumped down to the street and homeward.",
        "He stopped in front of Billy's Bar, in the middle of a block, and put his foot up on the hub of a dirty old Ford, to tie his shoelace.",
        "As he tied it—after having untied it—he looked up and down the street, emptied the bundles in his pockets into a battered sap bucket on the front seat of the car, and majestically moved on.",
        "Out of the bar came Pete Vutong, a French-Canadian farmer who lived up on Mount Terror.",
        "Pete was obviously drunk.",
        "He was singing the pre-historic ditty \"Hi lee, hi low\" in what he conceived to be German, viz.: \"By unz gays immer, yuh longer yuh slimmer.\" He was staggering so that he had to pull himself into the car, and he steered in fancy patterns till he had turned the corner.",
        "Then he was amazingly and suddenly sober; and amazing was the speed with which the Ford clattered out of town.",
        "Pete Vutong wasn't a very good Secret Agent.",
        "He was a little obvious.",
        "But then, Pete had been a spy for only one week.",
        "In that week Dan Wilgus had four times dropped heavy packages into a sap bucket in the Ford.",
        "Pete passed the gate to Buck Titus's domain, slowed down, dropped the sap bucket into a ditch, and sped home.",
        "Just at dawn, Buck Titus, out for a walk with his three Irish wolfhounds, kicked up the sap bucket and transferred the bundles to his own pocket.",
        "And next afternoon Dan Wilgus, in the basement of Buck's house, was setting up, in eight-point, a pamphlet entitled \"How Many People Have the Corpos Murdered?\" It was signed \"Spartan,\" and Spartan was one of several pen names of Mr.",
        "Doremus Jessup.",
        "They were all—all the ringleaders of the local chapter of the New Underground—rather glad when once, on his way to Buck's, Dan was searched by M.M.'s unfamiliar to him, and on him was found no printing-material, nor any documents more incriminating than cigarette papers.",
        "The Corpos had made a regulation licensing all dealers in printing machinery and paper and compelling them to keep lists of purchasers, so that except by bootlegging it was impossible to get supplies for the issuance of treasonable literature.",
        "Dan Wilgus stole the type; Dan and Doremus and Julian and Buck together had stolen an entire old hand printing-press from the Informer basement; and the paper was smuggled from Canada by that veteran bootlegger, John Pollikop, who rejoiced at being back in the good old occupation of which repeal had robbed him.",
        "It is doubtful whether Dan Wilgus would ever have joined anything so divorced as this from the time clock and the office cuspidors out of abstract indignation at Windrip or County Commissioner Ledue.",
        "He was moved to sedition partly by fondness for Doremus and partly by indignation at Doc Itchitt, who publicly rejoiced because all the printers' unions had been sunk in the governmental confederations.",
        "Or perhaps because Doc jeered at him personally on the few occasions—not more than once or twice a week—when there was tobacco juice on his shirt front.",
        "Dan grunted to Doremus, \"All right, boss, I guess maybe I'll come in with you.",
        "And say, when we get this man's revolution going, let me drive the tumbril with Doc in it.",
        "Say, remember A Tale of Two Cities?",
        "Good book.",
        "Say, how about getting out a humorous life of Windrip?",
        "You'd just have to tell the facts!\"\r\n\r\nBuck Titus, pleased as a boy invited to go camping, offered his secluded house and, in especial, its huge basement for the headquarters of the New Underground, and Buck, Dan, and Doremus made their most poisonous plots with the assistance of hot rum punches at Buck's fireplace.",
        "The Fort Beulah cell of the N.U., as it was composed in mid-March, a couple of weeks after Doremus had founded it, consisted of himself, his daughters, Buck, Dan, Lorinda, Julian Falck, Dr.",
        "Olmsted, John Pollikop, Father Perefixe (and he argued with the agnostic Dan, the atheist Pollikop, more than ever he had with Buck), Mrs.",
        "Henry Veeder, whose farmer husband was in Trianon Concentration Camp, Harry Kindermann, the dispossessed Jew, Mungo Kitterick, that most un-Jewish and un-Socialistic lawyer, Pete Vutong and Daniel Babcock, farmers, and some dozen others.",
        "The Reverend Mr.",
        "Falck, Emma Jessup, and Mrs.",
        "Candy, were more or less unconscious tools of the N.U.",
        "But whoever they were, of whatever faith or station, Doremus found in all of them the religious passion he had missed in the churches; and if altars, if windows of many-colored glass, had never been peculiarly holy objects to him, he understood them now as he gloated over such sacred trash as scarred type and a creaking hand press.",
        "Once it was Mr.",
        "Dimick of Albany again; once, another insurance agent—who guffawed at the accidental luck of insuring Shad Ledue's new Lincoln; once it was an Armenian peddling rugs; once, Mr.",

        "That you have a DUTY toward the dull human race—which probably enjoys being bullied by Windrip and getting bread and circuses— except for the bread!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's religious, a revolutionary loyalty!",
        "Why not?",
        "It's one of the few real religious feelings.",
        "A rational, unsentimental Stalin is still kind of a priest.",
        "No wonder most preachers hate the Reds and preach against 'em!",
        "They're jealous of their religious power.",
        "But—Oh, we can't unfold the world, this morning, even over breakfast coffee, Doremus!",
        "When Mr.",
        "Dimick came back here yesterday, he ordered me to Beecher Falls—you know, on the Canadian border—to take charge of the N.U.",
        "cell there—ostensibly to open up a tea room for this summer.",
        "So, hang it, I've got to leave you, and leave Buck and Sis, and go.",
        "Hang it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Linda!\"\r\n\r\nShe would not look at him.",
        "She made much, too much, of grinding out her cigarette.",

        "Linda!",
        "Do you want to get away from me so much?",
        "You—my life!\"\r\n\r\nShe came slowly to the bed, slowly sat down beside him.",
        "\"Yes.",
        "Get away from you and get away from myself.",
        "The world's in chains, and I can't be free to love till I help tear them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will never be out of chains!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall never be free to love!",
        "Oh, if we could only have run away together for one sweet year, when I was eighteen!",
        "Then I would have lived two whole lives.",
        "Well, nobody seems to be very lucky at turning the clock back—almost twenty-five years back, too.",
        "I'm afraid Now is a fact you can't dodge.",
        "And I've been getting so—just this last two weeks, with April coming in—that I can't think of anything but you.",
        "Kiss me.",
        "I'm going.",
        "Today.\"\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nAS usually happens in secret service, no one detail that Sissy ferreted out of Shad Ledue was drastically important to the N.U., but, like necessary bits of a picture puzzle, when added to other details picked up by Doremus and Buck and Mary and Father Perefixe, that trained extractor of confessions, they showed up the rather simple schemes of this gang of Corpo racketeers who were so touchingly accepted by the People as patriotic shepherds.",
        "Sissy lounged with Julian on the porch, on a deceptively mild April day.",
        "\"Golly, like to take you off camping, couple months from now, Sis.",
        "Just the two of us.",

        "I warn you, I'll kill Shad!",
        "I mean it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do have to, dear.",
        "I think I've got Shad crazy enough about me so that tonight, when he chases good old Emil, and whatever foul female Emil may bring, out of the place, I'll get him to tell me something about who they're planning to pinch next.",
        "I'm not scared of Shad, my Julian of jewelians.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not smile.",
        "He said, with a gravity that had been unknown to the lively college youth, \"Do you realize, with your kidding yourself about being able to handle Comrade Shad so well, that he's husky as a gorilla and just about as primitive?",
        "One of these nights—God!",
        "think of it!",
        "maybe tonight!—he'll go right off the deep end and grab you and—bing!\"\r\n\r\nShe was as grave.",
        "\"Julian, just what do you think could happen to me?",
        "The worst that could happen would be that I'd get raped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord—\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you honestly suppose that since the New Civilization began, say in 1914, anyone believes that kind of thing is more serious than busting an ankle?",
        "'A fate worse than death'!",
        "What nasty old side-whiskered deacon ever invented that phrase?",
        "And how he must have rolled it on his chapped old lips!",

        "No—wait!",
        "I'm not really flippant.",
        "I haven't any desire, beyond maybe a slight curiosity, to be raped—at least, not by Shad; he's a little too strong on the Bodily Odor when he gets excited.",
        "(Oh God, darling, what a nasty swine that man is!",
        "I hate him fifty times as much as you do.",
        "Ugh!) But I'd be willing to have even that happen if I could save one decent person from his bloody blackjack.",
        "I'm not the playgirl of Pleasant Hill any more; I'm a frightened woman from Mount Terror!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed, the whole thing, rather unreal to Sissy; a burlesqued version of the old melodramas in which the City Villain tries to ruin Our Nell, apropos of a bottle of Champagne Wine.",
        "Shad, even in a belted tweed jacket, a kaleidoscopic Scotch sweater (from Minnesota), and white linen plus-fours, hadn't the absent-minded seductiveness that becomes a City Slicker.",
        "Ensign Emil Staubmeyer had showed up at Shad's new private suite at the Star Hotel with a grass widow who betrayed her gold teeth and who had tried to repair the erosions in the fair field of her neck with overmuch topsoil of brick-tinted powder.",
        "She was pretty dreadful.",
        "She was harder to tolerate than the rumbling Shad—a man for whom the chaplain might even have been a little sorry, after he was safely hanged.",
        "The synthetic widow was always nudging herself at Emil and when, rather wearily, he obliged by poking her shoulder, she giggled, \"Now you SSSSTOP!\"\r\n\r\nShad's suite was clean, and had some air.",
        "Beyond that there was nothing much to say.",
        "The \"parlor\" was firmly furnished in oak chairs and settee with leather upholstery, and four pictures of marquises not doing anything interesting.",
        "The freshness of the linen spread on the brass bedstead in the other room fascinated Sissy uncomfortably.",
        "Shad served them rye highballs with ginger ale from a quart bottle that had first been opened at least a day ago, sandwiches with chicken and ham that tasted of niter, and ice cream with six colors but only two flavors—both strawberry.",
        "Then he waited, not too patiently, looking as much like General Göring as possible, for Emil and his woman to get the devil out of here, and for Sissy to acknowledge his virile charms.",
        "He only grunted at Emil's pedagogic little jokes, and the man of culture abruptly got up and removed his lady, whinnying in farewell, \"Now, Captain, don't you and your girl-friend do anything Papa wouldn't do!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come on now, baby—come over here and give us a kiss,\" Shad roared, as he flopped into the corner of the leather settee.",
        "\"Now I don't know whether I will or not!\" It nauseated her a good deal, but she made herself as pertly provocative as she could.",
        "She minced to the settee, and sat just far enough from his hulking side for him to reach over and draw her toward him.",
        "She observed him cynically, recalling her experience with most of the Boys...",
        "though not with Julian...",
        "well, not so much with Julian.",
        "They always, all of them, went through the same procedure, heavily pretending that there was no system in their manual proposals; and to a girl of spirit, the chief diversion in the whole business was watching their smirking pride in their technique.",
        "The only variation, ever, was whether they started in at the top or the bottom.",
        "Yes.",
        "She thought so.",
        "Shad, not being so delicately fanciful as, say, Malcolm Tasbrough, started with an apparently careless hand on her knee.",
        "She shivered.",
        "His sinewy paw was to her like the slime and writhing of an eel.",
        "She moved away with a maidenly alarm which mocked the rôle of Mata Hari she had felt herself to be gracing.",
        "\"Like me?\" he demanded.",
        "\"Oh—well—sort of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shucks!",
        "You think I'm still just a hired man!",
        "Even though I am a County Commissioner now!",
        "and a Battalion-Leader!",
        "and prob'ly pretty soon I'll be a Commander!\" He spoke the sacred names with awe.",
        "It was the twentieth time he had made the same plaint to her in the same words.",
        "\"And you still think I ain't good for anything except lugging in kindling!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Shad dear!",
        "Why, I always think of you as being just about my oldest playmate!",
        "The way I used to tag after you and ask you could I run the lawnmower!",
        "My!",
        "I always remember that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you, honest?\" He yearned at her like a lumpish farm dog.",
        "\"Of course!",
        "And honest, it makes me tired, your acting as if you were ashamed of having worked for us!",
        "Why, don't you know that, when he was a boy, Daddy used to work as a farm hand, and split wood and tend lawn for the neighbors and all that, and he was awful glad to get the money?\" She reflected that this thumping and entirely impromptu lie was beautiful....",
        "That it happened not to be a lie, she did not know.",
        "\"That a fact?",
        "Well!",
        "Honest?",
        "Well!",
        "So the old man used to hustle the rake too!",
        "Never knew that!",
        "You know, he ain't such a bad old coot—just awful stubborn.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do like him, DON'T you, Shad!",
        "Nobody knows how sweet he is—I mean, in these sort of complicated days, we've got to protect him against people that might not understand him, against outsiders, don't you think so, Shad?",
        "You will protect him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll do what I can,\" said the Battalion-Leader with such fat complacency that Sissy almost slapped him.",
        "\"That is, as long as he behaves himself, baby, and don't get mixed up with any of these Red rebels...",
        "and as long as you feel like being nice to a fella!\" He pulled her toward him as though he were hauling a bag of grain out of a wagon.",
        "\"Oh!",
        "Shad!",
        "You frighten me!",
        "Oh, you must be gentle!",
        "A big, strong man like you can afford to be gentle.",
        "It's only the sissies that have to get rough.",
        "And you're so strong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess I can still feed myself!",
        "Say, talking about sissies, what do you see in a light-waisted mollycoddle like Julian?",
        "You don't really like him, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you know how it is,\" she said, trying without too much obviousness to ease her head away from his shoulder.",
        "\"We've always been playmates, since we were kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you just said I was, too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's so.\"\r\n\r\nNow in her effort to give all the famous pleasures of seduction without taking any of the risk, the amateur secret-service operative, Sissy, had a slightly confused aim.",
        "She was going to get from Shad information valuable to the N.U.",
        "Rapidly rehearsing it in her imagination, the while she was supposed to be weakened by the charm of leaning against Shad's meaty shoulder, she heard herself teasing him into giving her the name of some citizen whom the M.M.'s were about to arrest, slickly freeing herself from him, dashing out to find Julian—oh, hang it, why hadn't she made an engagement with Julian for that night?—well, he'd either be at home or out driving Dr.",
        "Olmsted—Julian's melodramatically dashing to the home of the destined victim and starting him for the Canadian border before dawn....",
        "And it might be a good idea for the refugee to tack on his door a note dated two days ago, saying that he was off on a trip, so that Shad would never suspect her....",
        "All this in a second of hectic story-telling, neatly illustrated in color by her fancy, while she pretended that she had to blow her nose and thus had an excuse to sit straight.",
        "Edging another inch or two away, she purred, \"But of course it isn't just physical strength, Shad.",
        "You have so much power politically.",
        "My!",
        "I imagine you could send almost anybody in Fort Beulah off to concentration camp, if you wanted to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I could put a few of 'em away, if they got funny!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you could—and will, too!",
        "Who you going to arrest next, Shad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh come on!",
        "Don't be so tightwad with all your secrets!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you trying to do, baby?",

        "You'd like to get the poor old fathead going, and find out everything he knows—and that's plenty, you can bet your sweet life on that!",
        "Nothing doing, baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shad, I'd just—I'd just love to see an M.M.",
        "squad arresting somebody once.",
        "It must be dreadfully exciting!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's exciting enough, all right, all right!",
        "When the poor chumps try to resist, and you throw their radio out of the window!",
        "Or when the fellow's wife gets fresh and shoots off her mouth too much, and so you just teach her a little lesson by letting her look on while you trip him up on the floor and beat him up—maybe that sounds a little rough, but you see, in the long run it's the best thing you can do for these beggars, because it teaches 'em to not get ugly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But—you won't think I'm horrid and unwomanly, will you?—but I would like to see you hauling out one of those people, just once.",
        "Come on, tell a fellow!",
        "Who are you going to arrest next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naughty, naughty!",
        "Mustn't try to kid papa!",
        "No, the womanly thing for you to do is a little love-making!",
        "Aw come on, let's have some fun, baby!",
        "You know you're crazy about me!\" Now he really seized her, his hand across her breasts.",
        "She struggled, thoroughly frightened, no longer cynical and sophisticated.",
        "She shrieked, \"Oh don't—don't!\" She wept, real tears, more from anger than from modesty.",
        "He loosened his grip a little, and she had the inspiration to sob, \"Oh, Shad, if you really want me to love you, you must give me time!",
        "You wouldn't want me to be a hussy that you could do anything you wanted to with—you, in your position?",
        "Oh, no, Shad, you couldn't do that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe,\" said he, with the smugness of a carp.",
        "She had sprung up, dabbling at her eyes—and through the doorway, in the bedroom, on a flat-topped desk, she saw a bunch of two or three Yale keys.",
        "Keys to his office, to secret cupboards and drawers with Corpo plans!",
        "Undoubtedly!",
        "Her imagination in one second pictured her making a rubbing of the keys, getting John Pollikop, that omnifarious mechanic, to file substitute keys, herself and Julian somehow or other sneaking into Corpo headquarters at night, perilously creeping past the guards, rifling Shad's every dread file—\r\n\r\nShe stammered, \"Do you mind if I go in and wash my face?",
        "All teary—so silly!",
        "You don't happen to have any face powder in your bathroom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, what d'you think I am?",
        "A hick, or a monk, maybe?",
        "You bet your life I've got some face powder—right in the medicine cabinet— two kinds—how's that for service?",
        "Ladies taken care of by the day or hour!\"\r\n\r\nIt hurt, but she managed something like a giggle before she went in and shut the bedroom door, and locked it.",
        "She tore across to the keys.",
        "She snatched up a pad of yellow scratch-paper and a pencil, and tried to make a rubbing of a key as once she had made rubbings of coins, for use in the small grocery shop of C.",
        "JESSUp & J.",
        "falck groSHERS.",
        "The pencil blur showed only the general outline of the key; the tiny notches which were the trick would not come clear.",
        "In panic, she experimented with a sheet of carbon paper, then toilet paper, dry and wet.",
        "She could not get a mold.",
        "She pressed the key into a prop hotel candle in a china stick by Shad's bed.",
        "The candle was too hard.",
        "So was the bathroom soap.",
        "And Shad was now trying the knob of the door, remarking \"Damn!\" then bellowing, \"Whayuh doin' in there?",
        "Gone to sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be right out!\" She replaced the keys, threw the yellow paper and the carbon paper out of the window, replaced the candle and soap, slapped her face with a dry towel, dashed on powder as though she were working against time at plastering a wall, and sauntered back into the parlor.",
        "Shad looked hopeful.",
        "In panic she saw that now, before he comfortably sat down to it and became passionate again, was her one time to escape.",
        "She snatched up hat and coat, said wistfully, \"Another night, Shad—you must let me go now, dear!\" and fled before he could open his red muzzle.",
        "Round the corner in the hotel corridor she found Julian.",
        "He was standing taut, trying to look like a watchdog, his right hand in his coat pocket as though it was holding a revolver.",
        "She hurled herself against his bosom and howled.",
        "\"Good God!",
        "What did he do to you?",
        "I'll go in and kill him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't get seduced.",
        "It isn't things like that that I'm bawling about!",
        "It's because I'm such a simply terribly awful spy!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut one thing came out of it.",
        "Her courage nerved Julian to something he had longed for and feared: to join the M.M.'s, put on uniform, \"work from within,\" and supply Doremus with information.",
        "\"I can get Leo Quinn—you know?—Dad's a conductor on the railroad?—used to play basketball in high school?—I can get him to drive Dr.",
        "Olmsted for me, and generally run errands for the N.U.",
        "He's got grit, and he hates the Corpos.",
        "But look, Sissy—look, Mr.",
        "Jessup—in order to get the M.M.'s to trust me, I've got to pretend to have a fierce bust-up with you and all our friends.",
        "Look!",
        "Sissy and I will walk up Elm Street tomorrow evening, giving an imitation of estranged lovers.",
        "How 'bout it, Sis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\" glowed that incorrigible actress.",
        "She was to be, every evening at eleven, in a birch grove just up Pleasant Hill from the Jessups', where they had played house as children.",
        "Because the road curved, the rendezvous could be entered from four or five directions.",
        "There he was to hand on to her his reports of M.M.",
        "plans.",
        "But when he first crept into the grove at night and she nervously turned her pocket torch on him, she shrieked at seeing him in M.M.",
        "uniform, as an inspector.",
        "That blue tunic and slanting forage cap which, in the cinema and history books, had meant youth and hope, meant only death now....",
        "She wondered if in 1864 it had not meant death more than moonlight and magnolias to most women.",
        "She sprang to him, holding him as if to protect him against his own uniform, and in the peril and uncertainty now of their love, Sissy began to grow up.",
        "CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE propaganda throughout the country was not all to the New Underground; not even most of it; and though the pamphleteers for the N.U., at home and exiled abroad, included hundreds of the most capable professional journalists of America, they were cramped by a certain respect for facts which never enfeebled the press agents for Corpoism.",
        "And the Corpos had a notable staff.",
        "It included college presidents, some of the most renowned among the radio announcers who aforetime had crooned their affection for mouth washes and noninsomniac coffee, famous ex-war-correspondents, ex- governors, former vice-presidents of the American Federation of Labor, and no less an artist than the public relations counsel of a princely corporation of electrical-goods manufacturers.",
        "The newspapers everywhere might no longer be so wishily-washily liberal as to print the opinions of non-Corpos; they might give but little news from those old-fashioned and democratic countries, Great Britain, France, and the Scandinavian states; might indeed print almost no foreign news, except as regards the triumphs of Italy in giving Ethiopia good roads, trains on time, freedom from beggars and from men of honor, and all the other spiritual benefactions of Roman civilization.",
        "But, on the other hand, never had newspapers shown so many comic strips—the most popular was a very funny one about a preposterous New Underground crank, who wore mortuary black with a high hat decorated with crêpe and who was always being comically beaten up by M.M.'s.",
        "Never had there been, even in the days when Mr.",
        "Hearst was freeing Cuba, so many large red headlines.",
        "Never so many dramatic drawings of murders—the murderers were always notorious anti-Corpos.",
        "Never such a wealth of literature, worthy its twenty-four-hour immortality, as the articles proving, and proving by figures, that American wages were universally higher, commodities universally lower-priced, war budgets smaller but the army and its equipment much larger, than ever in history.",
        "Never such righteous polemics as the proofs that all non-Corpos were Communists.",
        "Almost daily, Windrip, Sarason, Dr.",
        "Macgoblin, Secretary of War Luthorne, or Vice-President Perley Beecroft humbly addressed their Masters, the great General Public, on the radio, and congratulated them on making a new world by their example of American solidarity— marching shoulder to shoulder under the Grand Old Flag, comrades in the blessings of peace and comrades in the joys of war to come.",
        "Much-heralded movies, subsidized by the government (and could there be any better proof of the attention paid by Dr.",
        "Macgoblin and the other Nazi leaders to the arts than the fact that movie actors who before the days of the Chief were receiving only fifteen hundred gold dollars a week were now getting five thousand?), showed the M.M.'s driving armored motors at eighty miles an hour, piloting a fleet of one thousand planes, and being very tender to a little girl with a kitten.",
        "Everyone, including Doremus Jessup, had said in 1935, \"If there ever is a Fascist dictatorship here, American humor and pioneer independence are so marked that it will be absolutely different from anything in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nFor almost a year after Windrip came in, this seemed true.",
        "The Chief was photographed playing poker, in shirtsleeves and with a derby on the back of his head, with a newspaperman, a chauffeur, and a pair of rugged steel-workers.",
        "Dr.",
        "Macgoblin in person led an Elks' brass band and dived in competition with the Atlantic City bathing-beauties.",
        "It was reputably reported that M.M.'s apologized to political prisoners for having to arrest them, and that the prisoners joked amiably with the guards...",
        "at first.",
        "All that was gone, within a year after the inauguration, and surprised scientists discovered that whips and handcuffs hurt just as sorely in the clear American air as in the miasmic fogs of Prussia.",
        "Doremus, reading the authors he had concealed in the horsehair sofa—the gallant Communist, Karl Billinger, the gallant anti- Communist, Tchernavin, and the gallant neutral, Lorant—began to see something like a biology of dictatorships, all dictatorships.",
        "The universal apprehension, the timorous denials of faith, the same methods of arrest—sudden pounding on the door late at night, the squad of police pushing in, the blows, the search, the obscene oaths at the frightened women, the third degree by young snipe of officials, the accompanying blows and then the formal beatings, when the prisoner is forced to count the strokes until he faints, the leprous beds and the sour stew, guards jokingly shooting round and round a prisoner who believes he is being executed, the waiting in solitude to know what will happen, till men go mad and hang themselves—\r\n\r\nThus had things gone in Germany, exactly thus in Soviet Russia, in Italy and Hungary and Poland, Spain and Cuba and Japan and China.",
        "Not very different had it been under the blessings of liberty and fraternity in the French Revolution.",
        "All dictators followed the same routine of torture, as if they had all read the same manual of sadistic etiquette.",
        "And now, in the humorous, friendly, happy-go-lucky land of Mark Twain, Doremus saw the homicidal maniacs having just as good a time as they had had in central Europe.",
        "America followed, too, the same ingenious finances as Europe.",
        "Windrip had promised to make everybody richer, and had contrived to make everybody, except for a few hundred bankers and industrialists and soldiers, much poorer.",
        "He needed no higher mathematicians to produce his financial statements: any ordinary press agent could do them.",
        "To show a 100 per cent economy in military expenditures, while increasing the establishment 700 per cent, it had been necessary only to charge up all expenditures for the Minute Men to non-military departments, so that their training in the art of bayonet-sticking was debited to the Department of Education.",
        "To show an increase in average wages one did tricks with \"categories of labor\" and \"required minimum wages,\" and forgot to state how many workers ever did become entitled to the \"minimum,\" and how much was charged as wages, on the books, for food and shelter for the millions in the labor camps.",
        "It all made dazzling reading.",
        "There had never been more elegant and romantic fiction.",
        "Even loyal Corpos began to wonder why the armed forces, army and M.M.'s together, were being so increased.",

        "Did he plan to attack all of North and South America and make himself an emperor?",
        "Or both?",
        "In any case, the forces were so swollen that even with its despotic power of taxation, the Corpo government never had enough.",
        "They began to force exports, to practice the \"dumping\" of wheat, corn, timber, copper, oil, machinery.",
        "They increased production, forced it by fines and threats, then stripped the farmer of all he had, for export at depreciated prices.",
        "But at home the prices were not depreciated but increased, so that the more we exported, the less the industrial worker in America had to eat.",
        "And really zealous County Commissioners took from the farmer (after the patriotic manner of many Mid-Western counties in 1918) even his seed grain, so that he could grow no more, and on the very acres where once he had raised superfluous wheat he now starved for bread.",
        "And while he was starving, the Commissioners continued to try to make him pay for the Corpo bonds which he had been made to buy on the instalment plan.",
        "But still, when he did finally starve to death, none of these things worried him.",
        "There were bread lines now in Fort Beulah, once or twice a week.",
        "The hardest phenomenon of dictatorship for a Doremus to understand, even when he saw it daily in his own street, was the steady diminution of gayety among the people.",
        "America, like England and Scotland, had never really been a gay nation.",
        "Rather it had been heavily and noisily jocular, with a substratum of worry and insecurity, in the image of its patron saint, Lincoln of the rollicking stories and the tragic heart.",
        "But at least there had been hearty greetings, man to man; there had been clamorous jazz for dancing, and the lively, slangy catcalls of young people, and the nervous blatting of tremendous traffic.",
        "All that false cheerfulness lessened now, day by day.",
        "The Corpos found nothing more convenient to milk than public pleasures.",
        "After the bread had molded, the circuses were closed.",

        "Even the most reckless youngsters went less and less to public entertainments, because no one not ostentatiously in uniform cared to be noticed, these days.",
        "It was impossible to sit in a public place without wondering which spies were watching you.",
        "So all the world stayed home—and jumped anxiously at every passing footstep, every telephone ring, every tap of an ivy sprig on the window.",
        "The score of people definitely pledged to the New Underground were the only persons to whom Doremus dared talk about anything more incriminating than whether it was likely to rain, though he had been the friendliest gossip in town.",
        "Always it had taken ten minutes longer than was humanly possible for him to walk to the Informer office, because he stopped on every corner to ask after someone's sick wife, politics, potato crop, opinions about Deism, or luck at fishing.",
        "As he read of rebels against the régime who worked in Rome, in Berlin, he envied them.",
        "They had thousands of government agents, unknown by sight and thus the more dangerous, to watch them; but also they had thousands of comrades from whom to seek encouragement, exciting personal tattle, shop talk, and the assurance that they were not altogether idiotic to risk their lives for a mistress so ungrateful as Revolution.",
        "Those secret flats in great cities— perhaps some of them really were filled with the rosy glow they had in fiction.",
        "But the Fort Beulahs, anywhere in the world, were so isolated, the conspirators so uninspiringly familiar one to another, that only by inexplicable faith could one go on.",
        "Now that Lorinda was gone, there certainly was nothing very diverting in sneaking round corners, trying to look like somebody else, merely to meet Buck and Dan Wilgus and that good woman, Sissy!",

        "I, uh—The fact is—I want you to be sure and not repeat this to anybody.",
        "I know you can be trusted with a secret, even if you are a newspaperman—or used to be, I mean, but— The fact is (and this is inside stuff; official), there's going to be some governmental promotions all along the line—this is confidential, and it comes to me straight from the Provincial Commissioner, Colonel Haik.",
        "Luthorne is finished as Secretary of War—he's a nice fellow, but he hasn't got as much publicity for the Corpos out of his office as the Chief expected him to.",
        "Haik is to have his job, and also take over the position of High Marshal of the Minute Men from Lee Sarason—I suppose Sarason has too much to do.",
        "Well then, John Sullivan Reek is slated to be Provincial Commissioner; that leaves the office of District Commissioner for Vermont-New Hampshire empty, and I'm one of the people being seriously considered.",
        "I've done a lot of speaking for the Corpos, and I know Dewey Haik very well—I was able to advise him about erecting public buildings.",
        "Of course there's none of the County Commissioners around here that measure up to a district commissionership—not even Dr.",
        "Staubmeyer—certainly not Shad Ledue.",
        "Now if you could see your way clear to throw in with me, your influence would help—\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, Frank, the worst thing you could have happen, if you want the job, is to have me favor you!",
        "The Corpos don't like me.",
        "Oh, of course they know I'm loyal, not one of these dirty, sneaking anti-Corpos, but I never made enough noise in the paper to please 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it, Remus!",

        "We'd all be greatly pleased if you came out and joined us.",
        "Now just suppose you did so and let people know that it was my influence that converted you to Corpoism.",
        "That might give me quite a leg-up.",
        "And between old friends like us, Remus, I can tell you that this job of District Commissioner would be useful to me in the quarry business, aside from the social advantages.",
        "And if I got the position, I can promise you that I'd either get the Informer taken away from Staubmeyer and that dirty little stinker, Itchitt, and given back to you to run absolutely as you pleased—providing, of course, you had the sense to keep from criticizing the Chief and the State.",
        "Or, if you'd rather, I think I could probably wangle a job for you as military judge (they don't necessarily have to be lawyers) or maybe President Peaseley's job as District Director of Education— you'd have a lot of fun out of that!—awfully amusing the way all the teachers kiss the Director's foot!",
        "Come on, old man!",
        "Think of all the fun we used to have in the old days!",
        "Come to your senses and face the inevitable and join us and fix up some good publicity for me.",
        "How about it—huh, huh?\"\r\n\r\nDoremus reflected that the worst trial of a revolutionary propagandist was not risking his life, but having to be civil to people like Future-Commissioner Tasbrough.",
        "He supposed that his voice was polite as he muttered, \"Afraid I'm too old to try it, Frank,\" but apparently Tasbrough was offended.",
        "He sprang up and tramped away grumbling, \"Oh, very well then!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I didn't give him a chance to say anything about being realistic or breaking eggs to make an omelet,\" regretted Doremus.",
        "The next day Malcolm Tasbrough, meeting Sissy on the street, made his beefy most of cutting her.",
        "At the time the Jessups thought that was very amusing.",
        "They thought the occasion less amusing when Malcolm chased little David out of the Tasbrough apple orchard, which he had been wont to use as the Great Western Forest where at any time one was rather more than likely to meet Kit Carson, Robin Hood, and Colonel Lindbergh hunting together.",
        "Having only Frank's word for it, Doremus could do no more than hint in Vermont Vigilance that Colonel Dewey Haik was to be made Secretary of War, and give Haik's actual military record, which included the facts that as a first lieutenant in France in 1918, he had been under fire for less than fifteen minutes, and that his one real triumph had been commanding state militia during a strike in Oregon, when eleven strikers had been shot down, five of them in the back.",
        "Then Doremus forgot Tasbrough completely and happily.",

        "Tasbrough was keeping his mouth shut when, toward the end of June, a newspaperman at Battington, Vermont, was suddenly arrested as editor of Vermont Vigilance and author of all the pamphlets by Doremus and Lorinda.",
        "He went to concentration camp.",
        "Buck and Dan Wilgus and Sissy prevented Doremus from confessing, and from even going to call on the victim, and when, with Lorinda no longer there as confidante, Doremus tried to explain it all to Emma, she said, Wasn't it lucky that the government had blamed somebody else!",
        "Emma had worked out the theory that the N.U.",
        "activity was some sort of a naughty game which kept her boy, Doremus, busy after his retirement.",
        "He was mildly nagging the Corpos.",
        "She wasn't sure that it was really nice to nag the legal authorities, but still, for a little fellow, her Doremus had always been surprisingly spunky—just like (she often confided to Sissy) a spunky little Scotch terrier she had owned when she was a girl—Mr.",
        "McNabbit its name had been, a little Scotch terrier, but my!",
        "so spunky he acted like he was a regular lion!",
        "She was rather glad that Lorinda was gone, though she liked Lorinda and worried about how well she might do with a tea room in a new town, a town where she had never lived.",
        "But she just couldn't help feeling (she confided not only to Sissy but to Mary and Buck) that Lorinda, with all her wild crazy ideas about women's rights, and workmen being just as good as their employers, had a bad influence on Doremus's tendency to show off and shock people.",
        "(She mildly wondered why Buck and Sissy snorted so.",
        "She hadn't meant to say anything particularly funny!)\r\n\r\nFor too many years she had been used to Doremus's irregular routine to have her sleep disturbed by his returning from Buck's at the improper time to which she referred as \"at all hours,\" but she did wish he would be \"more on time for his meals,\" and she gave up the question of why, these days, he seemed to like to associate with Ordinary People like John Pollikop, Dan Wilgus, Daniel Babcock, and Pete Vutong—my!",
        "some people said Pete couldn't even read and write, and Doremus so educated and all!",
        "Why didn't he see more of lovely people like Frank Tasbrough and Professor Staubmeyer and Mr.",

        "Like David, now ten years old (and like twenty or thirty million other Americans, from one to a hundred, but all of the same mental age), Emma thought the marching M.M.'s were a very fine show indeed, so much like movies of the Civil War, really quite educational; and while of course if Doremus didn't care for President Windrip, she was opposed to him also, yet didn't Mr.",

        "It was rumored in N.U.",

        "But Mr.",
        "Sullivan Reek did not in series go on to be Provincial Commissioner.",
        "It was said that he had too many friends among just the old-line politicians whose jobs the Corpos were so enthusiastically taking.",
        "No, the new Provincial Commissioner, viceroy and general, was Military Judge Effingham Swan, the one man whom Mary Jessup Greenhill hated more than she did Shad Ledue.",
        "Swan was a splendid commissioner.",
        "Within three days after taking office, he had John Sullivan Reek and seven assistant district commissioners arrested, tried, and imprisoned, all within twenty-four hours, and an eighty-year-old woman, mother of a New Underground agent but not otherwise accused of wickedness, penned in a concentration camp for the more desperate traitors.",
        "It was in a disused quarry which was always a foot deep in water.",
        "After he had sentenced her, Swan was said to have bowed to her most courteously.",
        "The New Underground sent out warning, from headquarters in Montreal, for a general tightening up of precautions against being caught distributing propaganda.",
        "Agents were disappearing rather alarmingly.",
        "Buck scoffed, but Doremus was nervous.",
        "He noticed that the same strange man, ostensibly a drummer, a large man with unpleasant eyes, had twice got into conversation with him in the Hotel Wessex lobby, and too obviously hinted that he was anti-Corpo and would love to have Doremus say something nasty about the Chief and the M.M.'s.",
        "Doremus became cautious about going out to Buck's.",
        "He parked his car in half-a-dozen different wood-roads and crept afoot to the secret basement.",
        "On the evening of the twenty-eighth of June, 1938, he had a notion that he was being followed, so closely did a car with red-tinted headlights, anxiously watched in his rear-view mirror, stick behind him as he took the Keezmet highway down to Buck's.",
        "He turned up a side road, down another.",
        "The spy car followed.",
        "He stopped, in a driveway on the left-hand side of the road, and angrily stepped out, in time to see the other car pass, with a man who looked like Shad Ledue driving.",
        "He swung round then and, without concealment, bolted for Buck's.",
        "In the basement, Buck was contentedly tying up bundles of the Vigilance, while Father Perefixe, in his shirtsleeves, vest open and black dickey swinging beneath his reversed collar, sat at a plain pine table, writing a warning to New England Catholics that though the Corpos had, unlike the Nazis in Germany, been shrewd enough to flatter prelates, they had lowered the wages of French-Canadian Catholic mill hands and imprisoned their leaders just as severely as in the case of the avowedly wicked Protestants.",
        "Perefixe smiled up at Doremus, stretched, lighted a pipe, and chuckled, \"As a great ecclesiast, Doremus, is it your opinion that I shall be committing a venial or a mortal sin by publishing this little masterpiece—the work of my favorite author—without the Bishop's imprimatur?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stephen!",
        "Buck!",

        "on the morning of June thirtieth.",
        "Doremus stayed home, writing sedition, all the afternoon and evening of the thirtieth, hiding the sheets under pages of newspaper in the Franklin stove in his study, so that he could touch them off with a match in case of a raid—a trick he had learned from Karl Billinger's anti-Nazi Fatherland.",
        "This new opus was devoted to murders ordered by Commissioner Effingham Swan.",
        "On the first and second of July, when he sauntered uptown, he was rather noticeably encountered by the same weighty drummer who had picked him up in the Hotel Wessex lobby before, and who now insisted on their having a drink together.",

        "Before he could quite get through the reflection that he recognized none of them, they were there in the room.",
        "The leader, an ensign (and most certainly Doremus did not recognize him) marched up to Doremus, looked at him casually, and struck him full in the face.",
        "Except for the one light pink of the bayonet when he had been arrested before, except for an occasional toothache or headache, or a smart when he had banged a fingernail, Doremus Jessup had not for thirty years known authentic pain.",
        "It was as incredible as it was horrifying, this torture in his eyes and nose and crushed mouth.",
        "He stood bent, gasping, and the Ensign again smashed his face, and observed, \"You are under arrest.\"\r\n\r\nMary had launched herself on the Ensign, was hitting at him with a china ash tray.",
        "Two M.M.'s dragged her off, threw her on the couch, and one of them pinned her there.",
        "The other two guards were bulking over the paralyzed Emma, the galvanized Sissy.",
        "Doremus vomited suddenly and collapsed, as though he were dead drunk.",
        "He was conscious that the five M.M.'s were yanking the books from the shelves and hurling them on the floor, so that the covers split, and with their pistol butts smashing vases and lamp shades and small occasional tables.",
        "One of them tattooed a rough M M on the white paneling above the fireplace with shots from his automatic.",
        "The Ensign said only, \"Careful, Jim,\" and kissed the hysterical Sissy.",
        "Doremus struggled to get up.",
        "An M.M.",
        "kicked him in the elbow.",
        "It felt like death itself, and Doremus writhed on the floor.",
        "He heard them tramping upstairs.",
        "He remembered then that his manuscript about the murders by Provincial Commissioner Effingham Swan was hidden in the Franklin stove in his study.",
        "The sound of their smashing of furniture in the bedrooms on the second floor was like that of a dozen wood-choppers gone mad.",
        "In all his agony, Doremus struggled to get up—to set fire to the papers in the stove before they should be found.",
        "He tried to look at his women.",
        "He could make out Mary, tied to the couch.",
        "(When had that ever happened?) But his vision was too blurred, his mind too bruised, to see anything clearly.",
        "Staggering, sometimes creeping on his hands and knees, he did actually get past the men in the bedrooms and up the stairs to the third floor and his study.",
        "He was in time to see the Ensign throwing his best-beloved books and his letter files, accumulated these twenty years, out of the study window, to see him search the papers in the Franklin stove, look up with cheerful triumph and cackle, \"Nice piece you've written here, I guess, Jessup.",
        "Commissioner Swan will love to see it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I demand—see—Commissioner Ledue—Dist' Commissioner Tasbrough— friends of mine,\" stammered Doremus.",
        "\"Don't know a thing about them.",
        "I'm running this show,\" the Ensign chuckled, and slapped Doremus, not very painfully, merely with a shamefulness as great as Doremus's when he realized that he had been so cowardly as to appeal to Shad and Francis.",
        "He did not open his mouth again, did not whimper nor even amuse the troopers by vainly appealing on behalf of the women, as he was hustled down two flights of stairs—they threw him down the lower flight and he landed on his raw shoulder—and out to the big car.",
        "The M.M.",
        "driver, who had been waiting behind the wheel, already had the engine running.",
        "The car whined away, threatening every instant to skid.",
        "But the Doremus who had been queasy about skidding did not notice.",
        "What could he do about it, anyway?",
        "He was helpless between two troopers in the back seat, and his powerlessness to make the driver slow up seemed part of all his powerlessness before the dictator's power...",
        "he who had always so taken it for granted that in his dignity and social security he was just slightly superior to laws and judges and policemen, to all the risks and pain of ordinary workers.",
        "He was unloaded, like a balky mule, at the jail entrance of the courthouse.",
        "He resolved that when he was led before Shad he would so rebuke the scoundrel that he would not forget it.",
        "But Doremus was not taken into the courthouse.",
        "He was kicked toward a large, black-painted, unlettered truck by the entrance—literally kicked, while even in his bewildered anguish he speculated, \"I wonder which is worse?—the physical pain of being kicked, or the mental humiliation of being turned into a slave?",
        "Hell!",
        "Don't be sophistical!",
        "It's the pain in the behind that hurts most!\"\r\n\r\nHe was hiked up a stepladder into the back of the truck.",
        "From the unlighted interior a moan, \"My God, not you too, Dormouse!\" It was the voice of Buck Titus, and with him as prisoners were Truman Webb and Dan Wilgus.",
        "Dan was in handcuffs, because he had fought so.",
        "The four men were too sore to talk much as they felt the truck lurch away and they were thrown against one another.",
        "Once Doremus spoke truthfully, \"I don't know how to tell you how ghastly sorry I am to have got you into this!\" and once he lied, when Buck groaned, \"Did those ——- ——-hurt the girls?\"\r\n\r\nThey must have ridden for three hours.",
        "Doremus was in such a coma of suffering that even though his back winced as it bounced against the rough floor and his face was all one neuralgia, he drowsed and woke to terror, drowsed and woke, drowsed and woke to his own helpless wailing.",
        "The truck stopped.",
        "The doors were opened on lights thick among white brick buildings.",
        "He hazily saw that they were on the one-time Dartmouth campus—headquarters now of the Corpo District Commissioner.",
        "That commissioner was his old acquaintance Francis Tasbrough!",
        "He would be released!",
        "They would be freed, all four!",
        "The incredulity of his humiliation cleared away.",
        "He came out of his sick fear like a shipwrecked man sighting an approaching boat.",
        "But he did not see Tasbrough.",
        "The M.M.'s, silent save for mechanical cursing, drove him into a hallway, into a cell which had once been part of a sedate classroom, left him with a final clout on the head.",
        "He dropped on a wooden pallet with a straw pillow and was instantly asleep.",
        "He was too dazed—he who usually looked recordingly at places—to note then or afterward what his cell was like, except that it appeared to be filled with sulphuric fumes from a locomotive engine.",
        "When he came to, his face seemed frozen stiff.",
        "His coat was torn, and foul with the smell of vomit.",
        "He felt degraded, as though he had done something shameful.",
        "His door was violently opened, a dirt-clotted bowl of feeble coffee, with a crust of bread faintly smeared with oleomargarine, was thrust at him, and after he had given them up, nauseated, he was marched out into the corridor, by two guards, just as he wanted to go to the toilet.",
        "Even that he could forget in the paralysis of fear.",
        "One guard seized him by the trim small beard and yanked it, laughing very much.",
        "\"Always did want to see whether a billygoat whisker would pull out or not!\" snickered the guard.",
        "While he was thus tormented, Doremus received a crack behind his ear from the other man, and a scolding command, \"Come on, goat!",
        "Want us to milk you?",
        "You dirty little so-and-so!",
        "What you in for?",
        "You look like a little Kike tailor, you little ——-\"\r\n\r\n\"Him?\" the other scoffed.",
        "\"Naw!",
        "He's some kind of a half-eared hick newspaper editor—they'll sure shoot him—sedition—but I hope they'll beat hell out of him first for being such a bum editor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Him?",
        "An editor?",
        "Say!",
        "Listen!",
        "I got a swell idea.",
        "Hey!",
        "Fellas!\" Four or five other M.M.'s, half dressed, looked out from a room down the hall.",
        "\"This-here is a writing-fellow!",
        "I'm going to make him show us how he writes!",
        "Lookit!\"\r\n\r\nThe guard dashed down the corridor to a door with the sign \"Gents\" hung out in front of it, came back with paper, not clean, threw it in front of Doremus, and yammered, \"Come on, boss.",
        "Show us how you write your pieces!",
        "Come on, write us a piece—with your nose!\" He was iron-strong.",
        "He pressed Doremus's nose down against the filthy paper and held it there, while his mates giggled.",
        "They were interrupted by an officer, commanding, though leniently, \"Come on, boys, cut out the monkeyshines and take this ——-to the bull pen.",
        "Trial this morning.\"\r\n\r\nDoremus was led to a dirty room in which half-a-dozen prisoners were waiting.",
        "One of them was Buck Titus.",
        "Over one eye Buck had a slatternly bandage which had so loosened as to show that his forehead was cut to the bone.",
        "Buck managed to wink jovially.",
        "Doremus tried, vainly, to keep from sobbing.",
        "He waited an hour, standing, arms tight at his side, at the demands of an ugly-faced guard, snapping a dog whip with which he twice slashed Doremus when his hands fell lax.",
        "Buck was led into the trial room just before him.",
        "The door was closed.",
        "Doremus heard Buck cry out terribly, as though he had been wounded to death.",
        "The cry faded into a choked gasping.",
        "When Buck was led out of the inner room, his face was as dirty and as pale as his bandage, over which blood was now creeping.",
        "The man at the door of the inner room jerked his thumb sharply at Doremus, and snarled, \"You're NEXT!\"\r\n\r\nNow he would face Tasbrough!",
        "But in the small room into which he had been taken—and he was confused, because somehow he had expected a large courtroom—there was only the Ensign who had arrested him yesterday, sitting at a table, running through papers, while a stolid M.M.",
        "stood on either side of him, rigid, hand on pistol holster.",
        "The Ensign kept him waiting, then snapped with disheartening suddenness, \"Your name!\"\r\n\r\n\"You know it!\"\r\n\r\nThe two guards beside Doremus each hit him.",
        "\"Your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doremus Jessup.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a Communist!\"\r\n\r\n\"No I'm not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-five lashes—and the oil.\"\r\n\r\nNot believing, not understanding, Doremus was rushed across the room, into a cellar beyond.",
        "A long wooden table there was dark with dry blood, stank with dry blood.",
        "The guards seized Doremus, sharply jerked his head back, pried open his jaws, and poured in a quart of castor oil.",
        "They tore off his garments above the belt, flung them on the sticky floor.",
        "They threw him face downward on the long table and began to lash him with a one-piece steel fishing rod.",
        "Each stroke cut into the flesh of his back, and they beat him slowly, relishing it, to keep him from fainting too quickly.",
        "But he was unconscious when, to the guards' great diversion, the castor oil took effect.",
        "Indeed he did not know it till he found himself limp on a messy piece of gunnysacking on the floor of his cell.",
        "They awakened him twice during the night to demand, \"You're a Communist, heh?",
        "You better admit it!",
        "We're going to beat the living tar out of you till you do!\"\r\n\r\nThough he was sicker than he had ever been in his life, yet he was also angrier; too angry to admit anything whatever, even to save his wrecked life.",
        "He simply snarled \"No.\" But on the third beating he savagely wondered if \"No\" was now a truthful answer.",
        "After each questioning he was pounded again with fists, but not lashed with the steel rod, because the headquarters doctor had forbidden it.",
        "He was a sporty-looking young doctor in plus-fours.",
        "He yawned at the guards, in the blood-reeking cellar, \"Better cut out the lashes or this ——-will pass out on you.\"\r\n\r\nDoremus raised his head from the table to gasp, \"You call yourself a doctor, and you associate with these murderers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shut up, you little ——-!",
        "Dirty traitors like you deserve to be beaten to death—and maybe you will be, but I think the boys ought to save you for the trial!\" The doctor showed his scientific mettle by twisting Doremus's ear till it felt as though it were torn off, chuckled, \"Go to it, boys,\" and ambled away, ostentatiously humming.",
        "For three nights he was questioned and lashed—once, late at night, by guards who complained of the inhuman callousness of their officers in making them work so late.",
        "They amused themselves by using an old harness strap, with a buckle on it, to beat him.",
        "He almost broke down when the examining Ensign declared that Buck Titus had confessed their illegal propaganda, and narrated so many details of the work that Doremus could almost have believed in the confession.",
        "He did not listen.",
        "He told himself, \"No!",
        "Buck would die before he'd confess anything.",
        "It's all Aras Dilley's spying.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ensign cooed, \"Now if you'll just have the sense to copy your friend Titus and tell us who's in the conspiracy besides him and you and Wilgus and Webb, we'll let you go.",
        "We know, all right—oh, we know the whole plot!—but we just want to find out whether you've finally come to your senses and been converted, my little friend.",
        "Now who else was there?",
        "Just give us their names.",
        "We'll let you go.",
        "Or would you like the castor oil and the whip again?\"\r\n\r\nDoremus did not answer.",
        "\"Ten lashes,\" said the Ensign.",
        "He was chased out for half an hour's walk on the campus every afternoon—probably because he would have preferred lying on his hard cot, trying to keep still enough so that his heart would stop its deathly hammering.",
        "Half a hundred prisoners marched there, round and round senselessly.",
        "He passed Buck Titus.",
        "To salute him would have meant a blow from the guards.",
        "They greeted each other with quick eyelids, and when he saw those untroubled spaniel eyes, Doremus knew that Buck had not squealed.",
        "And in the exercise yard he saw Dan Wilgus, but Dan was not walking free; he was led out from the torture rooms by guards, and with his crushed nose, his flattened ear, he looked as though he had been pounded by a prizefighter.",
        "He seemed partly paralyzed.",
        "Doremus tried to get information about Dan from a guard in his cell corridor.",
        "The guard—a handsome, clear-cheeked young man, noted in a valley of the White Mountains as a local beau, and very kind to his mother—laughed, \"Oh, your friend Wilgus?",
        "That chump thinks he can lick his weight in wildcats.",
        "I hear he always tries to soak the guards.",
        "They'll take that out of him, all right!\"\r\n\r\nDoremus thought, that night—he could not be sure, but he thought he heard Dan wailing, half the night.",
        "Next morning he was told that Dan, who had always been so disgusted when he had had to set up the news of a weakling's suicide, had hanged himself in his cell.",
        "Then, unexpectedly, Doremus was taken into a room, this time reasonably large, a former English classroom turned into a court, for his trial.",
        "But it was not District Commissioner Francis Tasbrough who was on the bench, nor any Military Judge, but no less a Protector of the People than the great new Provincial Commissioner, Effingham Swan.",
        "Swan was looking at Doremus's article about him as Doremus was led up to stand before the bench.",
        "He spoke—and this harsh, tired-looking man was no longer the airy Rhodes Scholar who had sported with Doremus once like a boy pulling the wings off flies.",
        "\"Jessup, do you plead guilty to seditious activities?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why—\" Doremus looked helplessly about for something in the way of legal counsel.",
        "\"Commissioner Tasbrough!\" called Swan.",
        "So at last Doremus did see his boyhood playmate.",
        "Tasbrough did nothing so commendable as to avoid Doremus's eyes.",
        "Indeed he looked at Doremus directly, and most affably, as he spoke his piece:\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency, it gives me great pain to have to expose this man, Jessup, whom I have known all my life, and tried to help, but he always was a smart-aleck—he was a laughing-stock in Fort Beulah for the way he tried to show off as a great political leader!—and when the Chief was elected, he was angry because he didn't get any political office, and he went about everywhere trying to disaffect people—I have heard him do so myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's enough.",
        "Thanks.",
        "County Commissioner Ledue...",
        "Captain Ledue, is it or is it not true that the man Jessup tried to persuade you to join a violent plot against my person?\"\r\n\r\nBut Shad did not look at Doremus as he mumbled, \"It's true.\"\r\n\r\nSwan crackled, \"Gentlemen, I think that that, plus the evidence contained in the prisoner's own manuscript, which I hold here, is sufficient testimony.",
        "Prisoner, if it weren't for your age and your damn silly senile weakness, I'd sentence you to a hundred lashes, as I do all the other Communists like you that threaten the Corporate State.",
        "As it is, I sentence you to be held in concentration camp, at the will of the Court, but with a minimum sentence of seventeen years.\" Doremus calculated rapidly.",
        "He was sixty-two now.",
        "He would be seventy-nine then.",
        "He never would see freedom again.",
        "\"And, in the power of issuing emergency decrees, conferred upon me as Provincial Commissioner, I also sentence you to death by shooting, but I suspend that sentence—though only until such time as you may be caught trying to escape!",
        "And I hope you'll have just lots and lots of time in prison, Jessup, to think about how clever you were in this entrancing article you wrote about me!",
        "And to remember that any nasty cold morning they may take you out in the rain and shoot you.\" He ended with a mild suggestion to the guards: \"And twenty lashes!\"\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later they had forced castor oil down him; he lay trying to bite at the stained wood of the whipping-table; and he could hear the whish of the steel fishing rod as a guard playfully tried it out in the air before bringing it down across the crisscross wounds of his raw back.",

        "In his seat the sick Doremus drooped again in listlessness.",
        "The prim Georgian buildings of the girls' school which had been turned into a concentration camp at Trianon, nine miles north of Fort Beulah, had been worse used than Dartmouth, where whole buildings were reserved for the luxuries of the Corpos and their female cousins, all very snotty and parvenu.",

        "His office was merely dreary, and scented with whisky, not, like the other rooms, with ammonia.",
        "Cowlick was not too ill-natured.",
        "He wished that the camp guards, all M.M.'s, would not treat the prisoners viciously, except when they tried to escape.",
        "But he was a mild man; much too mild to hurt the feelings of the M.M.'s and perhaps set up inhibitions in their psyches by interfering with their methods of discipline.",
        "The poor fellows probably meant well when they lashed noisy inmates for insisting they had committed no crime.",

        "It was better, too, than the undesirable idleness of being disciplined in the \"dog house\" where you lay naked, in darkness, and where \"bad cases\" were reformed by being kept awake for forty-eight or even ninety-six hours.",
        "Doremus was a conscientious toilet-cleaner.",

        "He chuckled when he thought of how many of his fellow criminals were acquaintances: Karl Pascal, Henry Veeder, his own cousin, Louis Rotenstern, who looked now like a corpse, unforgettingly wounded in his old pride of having become a \"real American,\" Clif Little, the jeweler, who was dying of consumption, Ben Tripper, who had been the jolliest workman in Medary Cole's gristmill, Professor Victor Loveland, of the defunct Isaiah College, and Raymond Pridewell, that old Tory who was still so contemptuous of flattery, so clean amid dirt, so hawk-eyed, that the guards were uncomfortable when they beat him....",
        "Pascal, the Communist, Pridewell, the squirearchy Republican, and Henry Veeder, who had never cared a hang about politics, and who had recovered from the first shocks of imprisonment, these three had become intimates, because they had more arrogance of utter courage than anyone else in the prison.",
        "For home Doremus shared with five other men a cell twelve feet by ten and eight feet high, which a finishing-school girl had once considered outrageously confined for one lone young woman.",
        "Here they slept, in two tiers of three bunks each; here they ate, washed, played cards, read, and enjoyed the leisurely contemplation which, as Captain Cowlick preached to them every Sunday morning, was to reform their black souls and turn them into loyal Corpos.",
        "None of them, certainly not Doremus, complained much.",
        "They got used to sleeping in a jelly of tobacco smoke and human stench, to eating stews that always left them nervously hungry, to having no more dignity or freedom than monkeys in a cage, as a man gets used to the indignity of having to endure cancer.",
        "Only it left in them a murderous hatred of their oppressors so that they, men of peace all of them, would gladly have hanged every Corpo, mild or vicious.",
        "Doremus understood John Brown much better.",
        "His cell mates were Karl Pascal, Henry Veeder, and three men whom he had not known: a Boston architect, a farm hand, and a dope fiend who had once kept questionable restaurants.",
        "They had good talk— especially from the dope fiend, who placidly defended crime in a world where the only real crime had been poverty.",
        "The worst torture to Doremus, aside from the agony of actual floggings, was the waiting.",
        "The Waiting.",
        "It became a distinct, tangible thing, as individual and real as Bread or Water.",
        "How long would he be in?",
        "How long would he be in?",
        "Night and day, asleep and waking, he worried it, and by his bunk saw waiting the figure of Waiting, a gray, foul ghost.",
        "It was like waiting in a filthy station for a late train, not for hours but for months.",
        "Would Swan amuse himself by having Doremus taken out and shot?",
        "He could not care much, now; he could not picture it, any more than he could picture kissing Lorinda, walking through the woods with Buck, playing with David and Foolish, or anything less sensual than the ever derisive visions of roast beef with gravy, of a hot bath, last and richest of luxuries where their only way of washing, except for a fortnightly shower, was with a dirty shirt dipped in the one basin of cold water for six men.",
        "Besides Waiting, one other ghost hung about them—the notion of Escaping.",
        "It was of that (far more than of the beastliness and idiocy of the Corpos) that they whispered in the cell at night.",
        "When to escape.",
        "How to escape.",
        "To sneak off through the bushes when they were out with the woods gang?",
        "By some magic to cut through the bars on their cell window and drop out and blessedly not be seen by the patrols?",
        "To manage to hang on underneath one of the prison trucks and be driven away?",
        "(A childish fantasy!) They longed for escape as hysterically and as often as a politician longs for votes.",
        "But they had to discuss it cautiously, for there were stool pigeons all over the prison.",
        "This was hard for Doremus to believe.",
        "He could not understand a man's betraying his companions, and he did not believe it till, two months after Doremus had gone to concentration camp, Clifford Little betrayed to the guards Henry Veeder's plan to escape in a hay wagon.",
        "Henry was properly dealt with.",
        "Little was released.",
        "And Doremus, it may be, suffered over it nearly as much as either of them, sturdily though he tried to argue that Little had tuberculosis and that the often beatings had bled out his soul.",
        "Each prisoner was permitted one visitor a fortnight and, in sequence, Doremus saw Emma, Mary, Sissy, David.",
        "But always an M.M.",
        "was standing two feet away, listening, and Doremus had from them nothing more than a fluttering, \"We're all fine—we hear Buck is all right—we hear Lorinda is doing fine in her new tea room— Philip writes he is all right.\" And once came Philip himself, his pompous son, more pompous than ever now as a Corpo judge, and very hurt about his father's insane radicalism—considerably more hurt when Doremus tartly observed that he would much rather have had the dog Foolish for visitor.",
        "And there were letters—all censored—worse than useless to a man who had been so glad to hear the living voices of his friends.",
        "In the long run, these frustrate visits, these empty letters, made his waiting the more dismal, because they suggested that perhaps he was wrong in his nightly visions; perhaps the world outside was not so loving and eager and adventurous as he remembered it, but only dreary as his cell.",
        "He had little known Karl Pascal, yet now the argumentative Marxian was his nearest friend, his one amusing consolation.",
        "Karl could and did prove that the trouble with leaky valves, sour cow pastures, the teaching of calculus, and all novels was their failure to be guided by the writings of Lenin.",
        "In his new friendship, Doremus was old-maidishly agitated lest Karl be taken out and shot, the recognition usually given to Communists.",
        "He discovered that he need not worry.",
        "Karl had been in jail before.",
        "He was the trained agitator for whom Doremus had longed in New Underground days.",
        "He had ferreted out so many scandals about the financial and sexual shenanigans of every one of the guards that they were afraid that even while he was being shot, he might tattle to the firing-squad.",
        "They were much more anxious for his good opinion than for that of Captain Cowlick, and they timidly brought him little presents of chewing tobacco and Canadian newspapers, as though they were schoolchildren honeying up to teacher.",
        "When Aras Dilley was transferred from night patrols in Fort Beulah to the position of guard at Trianon—a reward for having given to Shad Ledue certain information about R.",
        "C.",
        "Crowley which cost that banker hundreds of dollars—Aras, that slinker, that able snooper, jumped at the sight of Karl and began to look pious and kind.",
        "He had known Karl before!",
        "Despite the presence of Stoyt, Ensign of guards, an ex-cashier who had once enjoyed shooting dogs and who now, in the blessed escape of Corpoism, enjoyed lashing human beings, the camp at Trianon was not so cruel as the district prison at Hanover.",
        "But from the dirty window of his cell Doremus saw horrors enough.",
        "One mid-morning, a radiant September morning with the air already savoring the peace of autumn, he saw the firing-squad marching out his cousin, Henry Veeder, who had recently tried to escape.",
        "Henry had been a granite monolith of a man.",
        "He had walked like a soldier.",
        "He had, in his cell, been proud of shaving every morning, as once he had done, with a tin basin of water heated on the stove, in the kitchen of his old white house up on Mount Terror.",
        "Now he stooped, and toward death he walked with dragging feet.",
        "His face of a Roman senator was smeared from the cow dung into which they had flung him for his last slumber.",
        "As they tramped out through the quadrangle gate, Ensign Stoyt, commanding the squad, halted Henry, laughed at him, and calmly kicked him in the groin.",
        "They lifted him up.",
        "Three minutes later Doremus heard a ripple of shots.",
        "Three minutes after that the squad came back bearing on an old door a twisted clay figure with vacant open eyes.",
        "Then Doremus cried aloud.",
        "As the bearers slanted the stretcher, the figure rolled to the ground.",
        "But one thing worse he was to see through the accursed window.",
        "The guards drove in, as new prisoners, Julian Falck, in torn uniform, and Julian's grandfather, so fragile, so silvery, so bewildered and terrified in his muddied clericals.",
        "He saw them kicked across the quadrangle into a building once devoted to instruction in dancing and the more delicate airs for the piano; devoted now to the torture room and the solitary cells.",
        "Not for two weeks, two weeks of waiting that was like ceaseless ache, did he have a chance, at exercise hour, to speak for a moment to Julian, who muttered, \"They caught me writing some inside dope about M.M.",
        "graft.",
        "It was to have gone to Sissy.",
        "Thank God, nothing on it to show who it was for!\" Julian had passed on.",
        "But Doremus had had time to see that his eyes were hopeless, and that his neat, smallish, clerical face was blue-black with bruises.",
        "The administration (or so Doremus guessed) decided that Julian, the first spy among the M.M.'s who had been caught in the Fort Beulah region, was too good a subject of sport to be wastefully shot at once.",
        "He should be kept for an example.",
        "Often Doremus saw the guards kick him across the quadrangle to the whipping room and imagined that he could hear Julian's shrieks afterward.",
        "He wasn't even kept in a punishment cell, but in an open barred den on an ordinary corridor, so that passing inmates could peep in and see him, welts across his naked back, huddled on the floor, whimpering like a beaten dog.",
        "And Doremus had sight of Julian's grandfather sneaking across the quadrangle, stealing a soggy hunk of bread from a garbage can, and fiercely chewing at it.",
        "All through September Doremus worried lest Sissy, with Julian now gone from Fort Beulah, be raped by Shad Ledue....",
        "Shad would leer the while, and gloat over his ascent from hired man to irresistible master.",
        "Despite his anguish over the Falcks and Henry Veeder and every uncouthest comrade in prison, Doremus was almost recovered from his beatings by late September.",
        "He began delightedly to believe that he would live for another ten years; was slightly ashamed of his delight, in the presence of so much agony, but he felt like a young man and—And straightway Ensign Stoyt was there (two or three o'clock at night it must have been), yanking Doremus out of his bunk, pulling him to his feet, knocking him down again with so violent a crack in his mouth that Doremus instantly sank again into all his trembling fear, all his inhuman groveling.",
        "He was dragged into Captain Cowlick's office.",
        "The Captain was courtly:\r\n\r\n\"Mr.",
        "Jessup, we have information that you were connected with Squad-Leader Julian Falck's treachery.",
        "He has, uh, well, to be frank, he's broken down and confessed.",
        "Now you yourself are in no danger, no danger whatever, of further punishment, if you will just help us.",
        "But we really must make a warning of young Mr.",
        "Falck, and so if you will tell us all you know about the boy's shocking infidelity to the colors, we shall hold it in your favor.",
        "How would you like to have a nice bedroom to sleep in, all by yourself?\"\r\n\r\nA quarter hour later Doremus was still swearing that he knew nothing whatever of any \"subversive activities\" on the part of Julian.",
        "Captain Cowlick said, rather testily, \"Well, since you refuse to respond to our generosity, I must leave you to Ensign Stoyt, I'm afraid....",
        "Be gentle with him, Ensign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yessr,\" said the Ensign.",
        "The Captain wearily trotted out of the room and Stoyt did indeed speak with gentleness, which was a surprise to Doremus, because in the room were two of the guards to whom Stoyt liked to show off:\r\n\r\n\"Jessup, you're a man of intelligence.",
        "No use your trying to protect this boy, Falck, because we've got enough on him to execute him anyway.",
        "So it won't be hurting him any if you give us a few more details about his treason.",
        "And you'll be doing yourself a good turn.\"\r\n\r\nDoremus said nothing.",
        "\"Going to talk?\"\r\n\r\nDoremus shook his head.",
        "\"All right, then....",
        "Tillett!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yessr.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring in the guy that squealed on Jessup!\"\r\n\r\nDoremus expected the guard to fetch Julian, but it was Julian's grandfather who wavered into the room.",
        "In the camp quadrangle Doremus had often seen him trying to preserve the dignity of his frock coat by rubbing at the spots with a wet rag, but in the cells there were no hooks for clothes, and the priestly garment—Mr.",
        "Falck was a poor man and it had not been very expensive at best— was grotesquely wrinkled now.",
        "He was blinking with sleepiness, and his silver hair was a hurrah's nest.",
        "Stoyt (he was thirty or so) said cheerfully to the two elders, \"Well, now, you boys better stop being naughty and try to get some sense into your mildewed old brains, and then we can all have some decent sleep.",
        "Why don't you two try to be honest, now that you've each confessed that the other was a traitor?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" marveled Doremus.",
        "\"Sure!",
        "Old Falck here says you carried his grandson's pieces to the Vermont Vigilance.",
        "Come on, now, if you'll tell us who published that rag—\"\r\n\r\n\"I have confessed nothing.",
        "I have nothing to confess,\" said Mr.",
        "Falck.",
        "Stoyt screamed, \"Will you shut up?",
        "You old hypocrite!\" Stoyt knocked him to the floor, and as Mr.",
        "Falck weaved dizzily on hands and knees, kicked him in the side with a heavy boot.",
        "The other two guards were holding back the sputtering Doremus.",
        "Stoyt jeered at Mr.",
        "Falck, \"Well, you old bastard, you're on your knees, so let's hear you pray!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall!\"\r\n\r\nIn agony Mr.",
        "Falck raised his head, dust-smeared from the floor, straightened his shoulders, held up trembling hands, and with such sweetness in his voice as Doremus had once heard in it when men were human, he cried, \"Father, Thou hast forgiven so long!",
        "Forgive them not but curse them, for they know what they do!\" He tumbled forward, and Doremus knew that he would never hear that voice again.",

        "I leave it to my economic confrères to explain such dull phenomena as wage-scales, and tell only what I saw, which is that the innumerable parades and vast athletic conferences of the Minute Men and the lads and lassies of the Corpo Youth Movement exhibited such rosy, contented faces, such undeviating enthusiasm for their hero, the Chief, M.",

        "You shall see for yourself.\" He conducted me by one of the marvelously speedy American automobiles to such a camp, near Washington, and having the workers assembled, he put to them frankly: \"Are you low in the heart?\" As one man they chorused, \"No,\" with a spirit like our own brave soldiers on the ramparts of Verdun.",

        "Macgoblin, and every worker whom I thus approached assured me that never has he been so well fed, so tenderly treated, and so assisted to find an almost poetic interest in his chosen work as in this labor camp—this scientific cooperation for the well-being of all.",
        "With a certain temerity I ventured to demand of M.",
        "Macgoblin what truth was there in the reports so shamefully circulated (especially, alas, in our beloved France) that in the concentration camps the opponents of Corpoism are ill fed and harshly treated.",
        "M.",
        "Macgoblin explained to me that there are no such things as \"concentration camps,\" if that term is to carry any penological significance.",
        "They are, actually, schools, in which adults who have unfortunately been misled by the glib prophets of that milk-and-water religion, \"Liberalism,\" are reconditioned to comprehend the new day of authoritative economic control.",
        "In such camps, he assured me, there are actually no guards, but only patient teachers, and men who were once utterly uncomprehending of Corpoism, and therefore opposed to it, are now daily going forth as the most enthusiastic disciples of the Chief.",
        "Alas that France and Great Britain should still be thrashing about in the slough of Parliamentarianism and so-called Democracy, daily sinking deeper into debt and paralysis of industry, because of the cowardice and traditionalism of our Liberal leaders, feeble and outmoded men who are afraid to plump for either Fascism or Communism; who dare not—or who are too power hungry—to cast off outmoded techniques, like the Germans, Americans, Italians, Turks, and other really courageous peoples, and place the sane and scientific control of the all-powerful Totalitarian State in the hands of Men of Resolution!",
        "In October, John Pollikop, arrested on suspicion of having just possibly helped a refugee to escape, arrived in the Trianon camp, and the first words between him and his friend Karl Pascal were no inquiries about health, but a derisive interchange, as though they were continuing a conversation broken only half an hour before:\r\n\r\n\"Well, you old Bolshevik, I told you so!",

        "And they had paid no attention to Shad when he had told his funny story about the stuck-up preacher in Fort Beulah, one Falck, who had been so jealous because the M.M.'s drilled on Sunday morning instead of going to his gospel shop that he had tried to get his grandson to make up lies about the M.M.'s, and whom Shad had amusingly arrested right in his own church!",
        "Not paid one bit of attention to him, even though he had carefully read all through the Chief's Zero Hour so he could quote it, and though he had been careful to be refined in his table manners and to stick out his little finger when he drank from a glass.",
        "He was lonely.",

        "As with all his colleagues, his professorship was taken over by a most worthy and needy white man, whose training in anthropology had been as photographer on one expedition to Yucatan.",
        "In the dissension between the Booker Washington school of Negroes who counseled patience in the new subjection of the Negroes to slavery, and the radicals who demanded that they join the Communists and struggle for the economic freedom of all, white or black, Professor Adams took the mild, Fabian former position.",
        "He went over the country preaching to his people that they must be \"realistic,\" and make what future they could; not in some Utopian fantasy but on the inescapable basis of the ban against them.",
        "Near Burlington, Vermont, there is a small colony of Negroes, truck farmers, gardeners, houseworkers, mostly descended from slaves who, before the Civil War, escaped to Canada by the \"Underground Railway\" conducted by such zealots as Truman Webb's grandfather, but who sufficiently loved the land of their forcible adoption to return to America after the war.",
        "From the colony had gone to the great cities young colored people who (before the Corpo emancipation) had been nurses, doctors, merchants, officials.",
        "This colony Professor Adams addressed, bidding the young colored rebels to seek improvement within their own souls rather than in mere social superiority.",
        "As he was in person unknown to this Burlington colony, Captain Oscar Ledue, nicknamed \"Shad,\" was summoned to censor the lecture.",
        "He sat hulked down in a chair at the back of the hall.",
        "Aside from addresses by M.M.",
        "officers, and moral inspiration by his teachers in grammar school, it was the first lecture he had ever heard in his life, and he didn't think much of it.",
        "He was irritated that this stuck-up nigger didn't spiel like the characters of Octavus Roy Cohen, one of Shad's favorite authors, but had the nerve to try to sling English just as good as Shad himself.",
        "It was more irritating that the loud-mouthed pup should look so much like a bronze statue, and finally, it was simply more than a guy could stand that the big bum should be wearing a Tuxedo!",
        "So when Adams, as he called himself, claimed that there were good poets and teachers and even doctors and engineers among the niggers, which was plainly an effort to incite folks to rebellion against the government, Shad signaled his squad and arrested Adams in the midst of his lecture, addressing him, \"You God-damn dirty, ignorant, stinking nigger!",

        "But they actually seemed to like Adams; talked to him as though he were white and educated!",
        "So Stoyt placed him in a solitary cell, where he could think over his crime in having bitten the hand that had fed him.",
        "The greatest single shock that ever came to the Trianon camp was in November, 1938, when there appeared among them, as the newest prisoner, Shad Ledue.",
        "It was he who was responsible for nearly half of them being there.",

        "But such cloudy causes were less discussed than the question of how they would murder Shad now they had him safe.",
        "All Minute Men who were under discipline, except only such Reds as Julian Falck, were privileged prisoners in the concentration camps; they were safeguarded against the common, i.e., criminal, i.e., political inmates; and most of them, once reformed, were returned to the M.M.",

        "At exercise hour, the discipline of the men marching out to the quadrangle was broken when one prisoner stumbled, with a cry, knocked over another man, and loudly apologized—just at the barred entrance of Shad Ledue's cell.",
        "The accident made a knot collect before the cell.",
        "Doremus, on the edge of it, saw Shad looking out, his wide face blank with fear.",
        "Someone, somehow, had lighted and thrown into Shad's cell a large wad of waste, soaked with gasoline.",
        "It caught the thin wallboard which divided Shad's cell from the next.",
        "The whole room looked presently like the fire box of a furnace.",
        "Shad was screaming, as he beat at his sleeves, his shoulders.",
        "Doremus remembered the scream of a horse clawed by wolves in the Far North.",
        "When they got Shad out, he was dead.",
        "He had no face at all.",
        "Captain Cowlick was deposed as superintendent of the camp, and vanished to the insignificance whence he had come.",
        "He was succeeded by Shad's friend, the belligerent Snake Tizra, now a battalion-leader.",
        "His first executive act was to have all the two hundred inmates drawn up in the quadrangle and to announce, \"I'm not going to tell you guys anything about how I'm going to feed you or sleep you till I've finished putting the fear of God into every one of you murderers!\"\r\n\r\nThere were offers of complete pardon for anyone who would betray the man who had thrown the burning waste into Shad's cell.",
        "It was followed by enthusiastic private offers from the prisoners that anyone who did thus tattle would not live to get out.",
        "So, as Doremus had guessed, they all suffered more than Shad's death had been worth—and to him, thinking of Sissy, thinking of Shad's testimony at Hanover, it had been worth a great deal; it had been very precious and lovely.",
        "A court of special inquiry was convened, with Provincial Commissioner Effingham Swan himself presiding (he was very busy with all bad works; he used aeroplanes to be about them).",
        "Ten prisoners, one out of every twenty in the camp, were chosen by lot and shot summarily.",
        "Among them was Professor Victor Loveland, who, for all his rags and scars, was neatly academic to the last, with his eyeglasses and his slick tow-colored hair parted in the middle as he looked at the firing-squad.",
        "Suspects like Julian Falck were beaten more often, kept longer in those cells in which one could not stand, sit, nor lie.",
        "Then, for two weeks in December, all visitors and all letters were forbidden, and newly arrived prisoners were shut off by themselves; and the cell mates, like boys in a dormitory, would sit up till midnight in whispered discussion as to whether this was more vengeance by Snake Tizra, or whether something was happening in the World Outside that was too disturbing for the prisoners to know.",
        "CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nWHEN the Falcks and John Pollikop had been arrested and had joined her father in prison, when such more timid rebels as Mungo Kitterick and Harry Kindermann had been scared away from New Underground activities, Mary Greenhill had to take over the control of the Fort Beulah cell, with only Sissy, Father Perefixe, Dr.",
        "Olmsted and his driver, and half-a-dozen other agents left, and control it she did, with angry devotion and not too much sense.",
        "All she could do was to help in the escape of refugees and to forward such minor anti-Corpo news items as she could discover, with Julian gone.",
        "The demon that had grown within her ever since her husband had been executed now became a great tumor, and Mary was furious at inaction.",
        "Quite gravely she talked about assassinations—and long before the day of Mary Greenhill, daughter of Doremus, gold-armored tyrants in towers had trembled at the menace of young widows in villages among the dark hills.",
        "She wanted, first, to kill Shad Ledue who (she did not know, but guessed) had probably done the actual shooting of her husband.",
        "But in this small place it might hurt her family even more than they had been hurt.",
        "She humorlessly suggested, before Shad was arrested and murdered, that it would be a pretty piece of espionage for Sissy to go and live with him.",
        "The once flippant Sissy, so thin and quiet ever since her Julian had been taken away, was certain that Mary had gone mad, and at night was terrified....",
        "She remembered how Mary, in the days when she had been a crystal-hard, crystal-bright sportswoman, had with her riding-crop beaten a farmer who had tortured a dog.",
        "Mary was fed-up with the cautiousness of Dr.",
        "Olmsted and Father Perefixe, men who rather liked a vague state called Freedom but did not overmuch care for being lynched.",
        "She stormed at them.",
        "Call themselves men?",
        "Why didn't they go out and do something?",
        "At home, she was irritated by her mother, who lamented hardly more about Doremus's jailing than she did about the beloved little tables that had been smashed during his arrest.",
        "It was equally the blasts about the greatness of the new Provincial Commissioner, Effingham Swan, in the Corpo press and memoranda in the secret N.U.",
        "reports about his quick death verdicts against prisoners that made her decide to kill this dignitary.",
        "Even more than Shad (who had not yet been sent to Trianon), she blamed him for Fowler's fate.",
        "She thought it out quite calmly.",
        "That was the sort of thinking that the Corpos were encouraging among decent home-body women by their program for revitalizing national American pride.",
        "Except with babies accompanying mothers, two visitors together were forbidden in the concentration camps.",
        "So, when Mary saw Doremus and, in another camp, Buck Titus, in early October, she could only murmur, in almost the same words to each of them, \"Listen!",
        "When I leave you I'll hold up David—but, heavens, what a husky lump he's become!—at the gate, so you can see him.",
        "If anything should ever happen to me, if I should get sick or something, when you get out you'll take care of David—won't you, WON'T you?\"\r\n\r\nShe was trying to be matter-of-fact, that they might not worry.",
        "She was not succeeding very well.",
        "So she drew out, from the small fund which her father had established for her after Fowler's death, enough money for a couple of months, executed a power of attorney by which either her mother or her sister could draw the rest, casually kissed David and Emma and Sissy good-bye, and—chatty and gay as she took the train—went off to Albany, capital of the Northeastern Province.",
        "The story was that she needed a change and was going to stay near Albany with Fowler's married sister.",
        "She did actually stay with her sister-in-law—long enough to get her bearings.",
        "Two days after her arrival, she went to the new Albany training-field of the Corpo Women's Flying Corps and enlisted for lessons in aviation and bombing.",
        "When the inevitable war should come, when the government should decide whether it was Canada, Mexico, Russia, Cuba, Japan, or perhaps Staten Island that was \"menacing her borders,\" and proceed to defend itself outwards, then the best women flyers of the Corps were to have Commissions in an official army auxiliary.",
        "The old-fashioned \"rights\" granted to women by the Liberals might (for their own sakes) be taken from them, but never had they had more right to die in battle.",
        "While she was learning, she wrote to her family reassuringly— mostly postcards to David, bidding him mind whatever his grandmother said.",
        "She lived in a lively boarding-house, filled with M.M.",
        "officers who knew all about and talked a little about the frequent inspection trips of Commissioner Swan, by aeroplane.",
        "She was complimented by quite a number of insulting proposals there.",
        "She had driven a car ever since she had been fifteen: in Boston traffic, across the Quebec plains, on rocky hill roads in a blizzard; she had made repairs at midnight; and she had an accurate eye, nerves trained outdoors, and the resolute steadiness of a madman evading notice while he plots death.",
        "After ten hours of instruction, by an M.M.",
        "aviator who thought the air was as good a place as any to make love in and who could never understand why Mary laughed at him, she made her first solo flight, with an admirable landing.",
        "The instructor said (among other things less apropos) that she had no fear; that the one thing she needed for mastery was a little fear.",
        "Meantime she was an obedient student in classes in bombing, a branch of culture daily more propagated by the Corpos.",
        "She was particularly interested in the Mills hand grenade.",
        "You pulled out the safety pin, holding the lever against the grenade with your fingers, and tossed.",
        "Five seconds after the lever was thus loosened, the grenade exploded and killed a lot of people.",
        "It had never been used from planes, but it might be worth trying, thought Mary.",
        "M.M.",
        "officers told her that Swan, when a mob of steel-workers had been kicked out of a plant and started rioting, had taken command of the peace officers, and himself (they chuckled with admiration of his readiness) hurled such a grenade.",
        "It had killed two women and a baby.",
        "Mary took her sixth solo flight on a November morning gray and quiet under snow clouds.",
        "She had never been very talkative with the ground crew but this morning she said it excited her to think she could leave the ground \"like a reg'lar angel\" and shoot up and hang around that unknown wilderness of clouds.",
        "She patted a strut of her machine, a high-wing Leonard monoplane with open cockpit, a new and very fast military machine, meant for both pursuit and quick jobs of bombing...",
        "quick jobs of slaughtering a few hundred troops in close formation.",
        "At the field, as she had been informed he would, District Commissioner Effingham Swan was boarding his big official cabin plane for a flight presumably into New England.",
        "He was tall; a distinguished, military-looking, polo-suggesting dignitary in masterfully simple blue serge with just a light flying-helmet.",
        "A dozen yes-men buzzed about him—secretaries, bodyguards, a chauffeur, a couple of county commissioners, educational directors, labor directors—their hats in their hands, their smiles on their faces, their souls wriggling with gratitude to him for permitting them to exist.",
        "He snapped at them a good deal and bustled.",
        "As he mounted the steps to the cabin (Mary thought of \"Casey Jones\" and smiled), a messenger on a tremendous motorcycle blared up with the last telegrams.",
        "There seemed to be half a hundred of the yellow envelopes, Mary marveled.",
        "He tossed them to the secretary who was humbly creeping after him.",
        "The door of the viceregal coach closed on the Commissioner, the secretary, and two bodyguards lumpy with guns.",
        "It was said that in his plane Swan had a desk that had belonged to Hitler, and before him to Marat.",
        "To Mary, who had just lifted herself up into the cockpit, a mechanic cried, admiringly pointing after Swan's plane as it lurched forward, \"Gee, what a grand guy that is—Boss Swan.",
        "I hear where he's flying down to Washington to chin with the Chief this morning—gee, think of it, with the Chief!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be awful if somebody took a shot at Mr.",
        "Swan and the Chief?",
        "Might change all history,\" Mary shouted down.",
        "\"No chance of that!",
        "See those guards of his?",
        "Say, they could stand off a whole regiment—they could lick Walt Trowbridge and all the other Communists put together!\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess that's so.",
        "Nothing but God shooting down from heaven could reach Mr.",
        "Swan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!",
        "That's good!",
        "But couple days ago I heard where a fellow was saying he figured out God had gone to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it's time for Him to wake up!\" said Mary, and raised her hand.",
        "Her plane had a top of two hundred and eighty-five miles an hour— Swan's golden chariot had but two hundred and thirty.",
        "She was presently flying above and a little behind him.",
        "His cabin plane, which had seemed huge as the Queen Mary when she had looked up at its wing-spread on the ground, now seemed small as a white dove, wavering above the patchy linoleum that was the ground.",
        "She drew from the pockets of her flying-jacket the three Mills hand grenades she had managed to steal from the school yesterday afternoon.",
        "She had not been able to get away with any heavier bomb.",
        "As she looked at them, for the first time she shuddered; she became a thing of warmer blood than a mere attachment to the plane, mechanical as the engine.",
        "\"Better get it over before I go ladylike,\" she sighed, and dived at the cabin plane.",
        "No doubt her coming was unwelcome.",
        "Neither Death nor Mary Greenhill had made a formal engagement with Effingham Swan that morning; neither had telephoned, nor bargained with irritable secretaries, nor been neatly typed down on the great lord's schedule for his last day of life.",
        "In his dozen offices, in his marble home, in council hall and royal reviewing-stand, his most precious excellence was guarded with steel.",
        "He could not be approached by vulgarians like Mary Greenhill—save in the air, where emperor and vulgarian alike are upheld only by toy wings and by the grace of God.",
        "Three times Mary maneuvered above his plane and dropped a grenade.",
        "Each time it missed.",
        "The cabin plane was descending, to land, and the guards were shooting up at her.",
        "\"Oh well!\" she said, and dived bluntly at a bright metal wing.",
        "In her last ten seconds she thought how much the wing looked like the zinc washboard which, as a girl, she had seen used by Mrs.",
        "Candy's predecessor—now what was her name?—Mamie or something.",
        "And she wished she had spent more time with David the last few months.",
        "And she noticed that the cabin plane seemed rather rushing up at her than she down at it.",
        "The crash was appalling.",
        "It came just as she was patting her parachute and rising to leap out—too late.",
        "All she saw was an insane whirligig of smashed wings and huge engines that seemed to have been hurled up into her face.",
        "CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nSPEAKING of Julian before he was arrested, probably the New Underground headquarters in Montreal found no unusual value in his reports on M.M.",
        "grafting and cruelty and plans for apprehending N.U.",
        "agitators.",
        "Still, he had been able to warn four or five suspects to escape to Canada.",
        "He had had to assist in several floggings.",
        "He trembled so that the others laughed at him; and he made his blows suspiciously light.",
        "He was set on being promoted to M.M.",
        "district headquarters in Hanover, and for it he studied typing and shorthand in his free time.",
        "He had a beautiful plan of going to that old family friend, Commissioner Francis Tasbrough, declaring that he wanted by his own noble qualities to make up to the divine government for his father's disloyalty, and of getting himself made Tasbrough's secretary.",
        "If he could just peep at Tasbrough's private files!",
        "Then there would be something juicy for Montreal!",
        "Sissy and he discussed it exultantly in their leafy rendezvous.",
        "For a whole half hour she was able to forget her father and Buck in prison, and what seemed to her something like madness in Mary's increasing restlessness.",
        "Just at the end of September she saw Julian suddenly arrested.",
        "She was watching a review of M.M.'s on the Green.",
        "She might theoretically detest the blue M.M.",
        "uniform as being all that Walt Trowbridge (frequently) called it, \"The old-time emblem of heroism and the battle for freedom, sacrilegiously turned by Windrip and his gang into a symbol of everything that is cruel, tyrannical, and false,\" but it did not dampen her pride in Julian to see him trim and shiny, and officially set apart as a squad-leader commanding his minor army of ten.",
        "While the company stood at rest, County Commissioner Shad Ledue dashed up in a large car, sprang up, strode to Julian, bellowed, \"This guy—this man is a traitor!\" tore the M.M.",
        "steering-wheel from Julian's collar, struck him in the face, and turned him over to his private gunmen, while Julian's mates groaned, guffawed, hissed, and yelped.",
        "She was not allowed to see Julian at Trianon.",
        "She could learn nothing save that he had not yet been executed.",
        "When Mary was killed, and buried as a military heroine, Philip came bumbling up from his Massachusetts judicial circuit.",
        "He shook his head a great deal and pursed his lips.",
        "\"I swear,\" he said to Emma and Sissy—though actually he did nothing so wholesome and natural as to swear—\"I swear I'm almost tempted to think, sometimes, that both Father and Mary have, or shall I say had, a touch of madness in them.",
        "There must be, terrible though it is to say it, but we must face facts in these troublous days, but I honestly think, sometimes, there must be a strain of madness somewhere in our family.",
        "Thank God I have escaped it!—if I have no other virtues, at least I am certainly sane!",
        "even if that may have caused the Pater to think I was nothing but mediocre!",
        "And of course you are entirely free from it, Mater.",
        "It's you that must watch yourself, Cecilia.\" (Sissy jumped slightly; not at anything so grateful as being called crazy by Philip, but at being called \"Cecilia.\" After all, she admitted, that probably was her name.) \"I hate to say it, Cecilia, but I've often thought you had a dangerous tendency to be thoughtless and selfish.",
        "Now Mater: as you know, I'm a very busy man, and I simply can't take a lot of time arguing and discussing, but it seems best to me, and I think I can almost say that it seems wise to Merilla, also, that, now that Mary has passed on, you should just close up this big house, or much better, try to rent it, as long as the poor Pater is—uh—as long as he's away.",
        "I don't pretend to have as big a place as this, but it's ever so much more modern, with gas furnace and up-to-date plumbing and all, and I have one of the first television sets in Rose Lane.",
        "I hope it won't hurt your feelings, and as you know, whatever people may say about me, certainly I'm one of the first to believe in keeping up the old traditions, just as poor dear old Eff Swan was, but at the same time, it seems to me that the old home here is a little on the dreary and old-fashioned side—of course I never COULD persuade the Pater to bring it up to date, but—Anyway, I want Davy and you to come live with us in Worcester, immediately.",
        "As for you, Sissy, you will of course understand that you are entirely welcome, but perhaps you would prefer to do something livelier, such as joining the Women's Corpo Auxiliary—\"\r\n\r\nHe was, Sissy raged, so damned KIND to everybody!",

        "uniform, and when David put it on and paraded about shouting, like most of the boys he played with, \"Hail Windrip!\"\r\n\r\nShe telephoned to Lorinda Pike at Beecher Falls and was able to tell Philip that she was going to help Lorinda in the tea room.",
        "Emma and David went off to Worcester—at the last moment, at the station, Emma decided to be pretty teary about it, though David begged her to remember that they had Uncle Philip's word for it that Worcester was just the same as Boston, London, Hollywood, and a Wild West Ranch put together.",
        "Sissy stayed to get the house rented.",
        "Mrs.",
        "Candy, who was going to open her bakery now and who never did inform the impractical Sissy whether or no she was being paid for these last weeks, made for Sissy all the foreign dishes that only Sissy and Doremus cared for, and they not uncheerfully dined together, in the kitchen.",
        "So it was Shad's time to swoop.",
        "He came blusteringly calling on her, in November.",
        "Never had she hated him quite so much, yet never so much feared him, because of what he might do to her father and Julian and Buck and the others in concentration camps.",
        "He grunted, \"Well, your boy-friend Jule, that thought he was so cute, the poor heel, we got all the dope on his double-crossing us, all right!",

        "Sir William Gilbert would have said of Shad that he was so very, very prolet-ari-an.",
        "She had played for but five minutes when he forgot that he was now refined, and bawled, \"Oh, cut out the highbrow stuff and come on and sit down!\"\r\n\r\nShe stayed on the piano stool.",
        "Just what would she do if Shad became violent?",
        "There was no Julian to appear melodramatically at the nickoftime and rescue her.",

        "Had Mary meant to kill Swan?",
        "Would They be harder on Julian and her father if she killed Shad?",
        "Incidentally, did it hurt much to get hanged?)\r\n\r\nHe was yawning, \"Well, Sis, ole kid, how about you and me taking a little trip to New York in a couple weeks?",
        "See some high life.",
        "I'll get you the best soot in the best hotel in town, and we'll take in some shows—I hear this Callin' Stalin is a hot number— real Corpo art—and I'll buy you some honest-to-God champagne wine!",
        "And then if we find we like each other enough, I'm willing for us, if you are, to get hitched!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Shad!",
        "We could never live on your salary.",

        "Believe me, I'm going to be a millionaire before very long!\"\r\n\r\nThen he told her: told her precisely the sort of discreditable secret for which she had so long fished in vain.",

        "Shad, when drunk, reversed all the rules and became more peasant-like and cautious with each drink.",
        "He had a plan.",
        "That plan was as brutal and as infeasible as any plan of Shad Ledue for making large money would be.",
        "Its essence was that he should avoid manual labor and should make as many persons miserable as possible.",
        "It was like his plan, when he was still a hired man, to become wealthy by breeding dogs—first stealing the dogs and, preferably, the kennels.",
        "As County Commissioner he had not merely, as was the Corpo custom, been bribed by the shopkeepers and professional men for protection against the M.M.'s.",

        "She did not ever see Shad Ledue again.",
        "She was very sick about his being killed.",
        "She was very sick about all killing.",
        "She found no heroism but only barbaric bestiality in having to kill so that one might so far live as to be halfway honest and kind and secure.",
        "But she knew that she would be willing to do it again.",
        "The Jessup house was magniloquently rented by that noble Roman, that political belch, Ex-Governor Isham Hubbard, who, being tired of again trying to make a living by peddling real estate and criminal law, was pleased to accept the appointment as successor to Shad Ledue.",

        "But that rat, Aras Dilley, is at Trianon as guard now.",
        "I'm bribing him to help your father escape.",
        "We'll have the man here for Christmas, only kind of late, and sneak him into Canada.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Sissy.",
        "A few days afterward, reading a coded New Underground telegram which apparently dealt with the delivery of furniture, Lorinda shrieked, \"Sissy!",
        "All you-know-what has busted loose!",
        "In Washington!",
        "Lee Sarason has deposed Buzz Windrip and grabbed the dictatorship!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Sissy.",
        "CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nIN his two years of dictatorship, Berzelius Windrip daily became more a miser of power.",
        "He continued to tell himself that his main ambition was to make all citizens healthy, in purse and mind, and that if he was brutal it was only toward fools and reactionaries who wanted the old clumsy systems.",
        "But after eighteen months of Presidency he was angry that Mexico and Canada and South America (obviously his own property, by manifest destiny) should curtly answer his curt diplomatic notes and show no helpfulness about becoming part of his inevitable empire.",
        "And daily he wanted louder, more convincing Yeses from everybody about him.",
        "How could he carry on his heartbreaking labor if nobody ever encouraged him?",
        "he demanded.",
        "Anyone, from Sarason to inter-office messenger, who did not play valet to his ego he suspected of plotting against him.",
        "He constantly increased his bodyguard, and as constantly distrusted all his guards and discharged them, and once took a shot at a couple of them, so that in all the world he had no companion save his old aide Lee Sarason, and perhaps Hector Macgoblin, to whom he could talk easily.",
        "He felt lonely in the hours when he wanted to shuck off the duties of despotism along with his shoes and his fine new coat.",
        "He no longer went out racketing.",
        "His cabinet begged him not to clown in barrooms and lodge entertainments; it was not dignified, and it was dangerous to be too near to strangers.",
        "So he played poker with his bodyguard, late at night, and at such times drank too much, and he cursed them and glared with bulging eyes whenever he lost, which, for all the good-will of his guards about letting him win, had to be often, because he pinched their salaries badly and locked up the spoons.",
        "He had become as unbouncing and unbuzzing a Buzz as might be, and he did not know it.",
        "All the while he loved the People just as much as he feared and detested Persons, and he planned to do something historic.",
        "Certainly!",
        "He would give each family that five thousand dollars a year just as soon now as he could arrange it.",
        "And Lee Sarason, forever making his careful lists, as patient at his desk as he was pleasure-hungry on the couch at midnight parties, was beguiling officials to consider him their real lord and the master of Corpoism.",
        "He kept his promises to them, while Windrip always forgot.",
        "His office door became the door of ambition.",
        "In Washington, the reporters privily spoke of this assistant secretary and that general as \"Sarason men.\" His clique was not a government within a government; it was the government itself, minus the megaphones.",
        "He had the Secretary of Corporations (a former vice-president of the American Federation of Labor) coming to him secretly every evening, to report on labor politics and in especial on such proletarian leaders as were dissatisfied with Windrip as Chief—i.e., with their own share in the swag.",
        "He had from the Secretary of the Treasury (though this functionary, one Webster Skittle, was not a lieutenant of Sarason but merely friendly) confidential reports on the affairs of those large employers who, since under Corpoism it was usually possible for a millionaire to persuade the judges in the labor-arbitration courts to look at things reasonably, rejoiced that with strikes outlawed and employers regarded as state officials, they would now be in secure power forever.",
        "Sarason knew the quiet ways in which these reinforced industrial barons used arrests by the M.M.'s to get rid of \"trouble-makers,\" particularly of Jewish radicals—a Jewish radical being a Jew with nobody working for him.",
        "(Some of the barons were themselves Jews; it is not to be expected that race-loyalty should be carried so insanely far as to weaken the pocketbook.)\r\n\r\nThe allegiance of all such Negroes as had the sense to be content with safety and good pay instead of ridiculous yearnings for personal integrity Sarason got by being photographed shaking hands with the celebrated Negro Fundamentalist clergyman, the Reverend Dr.",
        "Alexander Nibbs, and through the highly publicized Sarason Prizes for the Negroes with the largest families, the fastest time in floor-scrubbing, and the longest periods of work without taking a vacation.",
        "\"No danger of our good friends, the Negroes, turning Red when they're encouraged like that,\" Sarason announced to the newspapers.",
        "It was a satisfaction to Sarason that in Germany, all military bands were now playing his national song, \"Buzz and Buzz\" along with the Horst Wessel hymn, for, though he had not exactly written the music as well as the words, the music was now being attributed to him abroad.",
        "As a bank clerk might, quite rationally, worry equally over the whereabouts of a hundred million dollars' worth of the bank's bonds, and of ten cents of his own lunch money, so Buzz Windrip worried equally over the welfare—that is, the obedience to himself—of a hundred and thirty-odd million American citizens and the small matter of the moods of Lee Sarason, whose approval of him was the one real fame.",
        "(His wife Windrip did not see oftener than once a week, and anyway, what that rustic wench thought was unimportant.)\r\n\r\nThe diabolic Hector Macgoblin frightened him; Secretary of War Luthorne and Vice-President Perley Beecroft he liked well enough, but they bored him; they smacked too much of his own small-town boyhood, to escape which he was willing to take the responsibilities of a nation.",
        "It was the incalculable Lee Sarason on whom he depended, and the Lee with whom he had gone fishing and boozing and once, even, murdering, who had seemed his own self made more sure and articulate, had thoughts now which he could not penetrate.",
        "Lee's smile was a veil, not a revelation.",
        "It was to discipline Lee, with the hope of bringing him back, that when Buzz replaced the amiable but clumsy Colonel Luthorne as Secretary of War by Colonel Dewey Haik, Commissioner of the Northeastern Province (Buzz's characteristic comment was that Luthorne was not \"pulling his weight\"), he also gave to Haik the position of High Marshal of the M.M.'s, which Lee had held along with a dozen other offices.",
        "From Lee he expected an explosion, then repentance and a new friendship.",
        "But Lee only said, \"Very well, if you wish,\" and said it coldly.",
        "Just how COULD he get Lee to be a good boy and come play with him again?",
        "wistfully wondered the man who now and then planned to be emperor of the world.",
        "He gave Lee a thousand-dollar television set.",
        "Even more coldly did Lee thank him, and never spoke afterward of how well he might be receiving the still shaky television broadcasts on his beautiful new set.",
        "As Dewey Haik took hold, doubling efficiency in both the regular army and the Minute Men (he was a demon for all-night practice marches in heavy order, and the files could not complain, because he set the example), Buzz began to wonder whether Haik might not be his new confidant....",
        "He really would hate to throw Lee into prison, but still, Lee was so thoughtless about hurting his feelings, when he'd gone and done so much for him and all!",
        "Buzz was confused.",
        "He was the more confused when Perley Beecroft came in and briefly said that he was sick of all this bloodshed and was going home to the farm, and as for his lofty Vice-Presidential office, Buzz knew what he could do with it.",
        "Were these vast national dissensions no different from squabbles in his father's drugstore?",
        "fretted Buzz.",
        "He couldn't very well have Beecroft shot: it might cause criticism.",
        "But it was indecent, it was sacrilegious to annoy an emperor, and in his irritation he had an ex-Senator and twelve workmen who were in concentration camps taken out and shot on the charge that they had told irreverent stories about him.",
        "Secretary of State Sarason was saying good-night to President Windrip in the hotel suite where Windrip really lived.",
        "No newspaper had dared mention it, but Buzz was both bothered by the stateliness of the White House and frightened by the number of Reds and cranks and anti-Corpos who, with the most commendable patience and ingenuity, tried to sneak into that historic mansion and murder him.",
        "Buzz merely left his wife there, for show, and, except at great receptions, never entered any part of the White House save the office annex.",
        "He liked this hotel suite; he was a sensible man, who preferred straight bourbon, codfish cakes, and deep leather chairs to Burgundy, trout bleu, and Louis Quinze.",
        "In this twelve-room apartment, occupying the entire tenth floor of a small unnotorious hotel, he had for himself only a plain bedroom, a huge living room which looked like a combination of office and hotel lobby, a large liquor closet, another closet with thirty-seven suits of clothes, and a bathroom with jars and jars of the pine-flavored bath salts which were his only cosmetic luxury.",
        "Buzz might come home in a suit dazzling as a horse blanket, one considered in Alfalfa Center a triumph of London tailoring, but, once safe, he liked to put on his red morocco slippers that were down at the heel and display his red suspenders and baby-blue sleeve garters.",
        "To feel correct in those decorations, he preferred the hotel atmosphere that, for so many years before he had ever seen the White House, had been as familiar to him as his ancestral corn cribs and Main Streets.",
        "The other ten rooms of the suite, entirely shutting his own off from the corridors and elevators, were filled night and day with guards.",
        "To get through to Buzz in this intimate place of his own was very much like visiting a police station for the purpose of seeing a homicidal prisoner.",
        "\"Haik seems to me to be doing a fine job in the War Department, Lee,\" said the President.",
        "\"Of course you know if you ever want the job of High Marshal back—\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm quite satisfied,\" said the great Secretary of State.",
        "\"What do you think of having Colonel Luthorne back to help Haik out?",
        "He's pretty good on fool details.\"\r\n\r\nSarason looked as nearly embarrassed as the self-satisfied Lee Sarason ever could look.",
        "\"Why, uh—I supposed you knew it.",
        "Luthorne was liquidated in the purge ten days ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!",
        "Luthorne killed?",
        "Why didn't I know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was thought better to keep it quiet.",
        "He was a pretty popular man.",
        "But dangerous.",
        "Always talking about Abraham Lincoln!\"\r\n\r\n\"So I just never know anything about what's going on!",
        "Why, even the newspaper clippings are predigested, by God, before I see 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's thought better not to bother you with minor details, boss.",
        "You know that!",
        "Of course, if you feel I haven't organized your staff correctly—\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw now, don't fly off the handle, Lee!",
        "I just meant—Of course I know how hard you've tried to protect me so I could give all my brains to the higher problems of State.",
        "But Luthorne—I kind of liked him.",
        "He always had quite a funny line when we played poker.\" Buzz Windrip felt lonely, as once a certain Shad Ledue had felt, in a hotel suite that differed from Buzz's only in being smaller.",
        "To forget it he bawled, very brightly, \"Lee, do you ever wonder what'll happen in the future?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I think you and I may have mentioned it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But golly, just think of what might happen in the future, Lee!",
        "Think of it!",
        "Why, we may be able to pull off a North American kingdom!\" Buzz half meant it seriously—or perhaps quarter meant it.",
        "\"How'd you like to be Duke of Georgia—or Grand Duke, or whatever they call a Grand Exalted Ruler of the Elks in this peerage business?",
        "And then how about an Empire of North and South America after that?",
        "I might make you a king under me, then—say something like King of Mexico.",
        "Howjuh like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be very amusing,\" said Lee mechanically—as Lee always did say the same thing mechanically whenever Buzz repeated this same nonsense.",
        "\"But you got to stick by me and not forget all I've done for you, Lee, don't forget that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never forget anything!...",
        "By the way, we ought to liquidate, or at least imprison, Perley Beecroft, too.",
        "He's still technically Vice-President of the United States, and if the lousy traitor managed some skullduggery so as to get you killed or deposed, he might be regarded by some narrow-minded literalists as President!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no!",
        "He's my friend, no matter what he says about me...",
        "the dirty dog!\" wailed Buzz.",
        "\"All right.",
        "You're the boss.",
        "G'night,\" said Lee, and returned from this plumber's dream of paradise to his own gold-and-black and apricot-silk bower in Georgetown, which he shared with several handsome young M.M.",
        "officers.",
        "They were savage soldiers, yet apt at music and at poetry.",
        "With them, he was not in the least passionless, as he seemed now to Buzz Windrip.",
        "He was either angry with his young friends, and then he whipped them, or he was in a paroxysm of apology to them, and caressed their wounds.",
        "Newspapermen who had once seemed to be his friends said that he had traded the green eyeshade for a wreath of violets.",
        "At cabinet meeting, late in 1938, Secretary of State Sarason revealed to the heads of the government disturbing news.",
        "Vice-President Beecroft—and had he not told them the man should have been shot?—had fled to Canada, renounced Corpoism, and joined Walt Trowbridge in plotting.",
        "There were bubbles from an almost boiling rebellion in the Middle West and Northwest, especially in Minnesota and the Dakotas, where agitators, some of them formerly of political influence, were demanding that their states secede from the Corpo Union and form a cooperative (indeed almost Socialistic) commonwealth of their own.",
        "\"Rats!",
        "Just a lot of irresponsible wind bags!\" jeered President Windrip.",
        "\"Why!",
        "I thought you were supposed to be the camera-eyed gink that kept up on everything that goes on, Lee!",
        "You forget that I myself, personally, made a special radio address to that particular section of the country last week!",
        "And I got a wonderful reaction.",
        "The Middle Westerners are absolutely loyal to me.",
        "They appreciate what I've been trying to do!\"\r\n\r\nNot answering him at all, Sarason demanded that, in order to bring and hold all elements in the country together by that useful Patriotism which always appears upon threat of an outside attack, the government immediately arrange to be insulted and menaced in a well-planned series of deplorable \"incidents\" on the Mexican border, and declare war on Mexico as soon as America showed that it was getting hot and patriotic enough.",
        "Secretary of the Treasury Skittle and Attorney General Porkwood shook their heads, but Secretary of War Haik and Secretary of Education Macgoblin agreed with Sarason high-mindedly.",
        "Once, pointed out the learned Macgoblin, governments had merely let themselves slide into a war, thanking Providence for having provided a conflict as a febrifuge against internal discontent, but of course, in this age of deliberate, planned propaganda, a really modern government like theirs must figure out what brand of war they had to sell and plan the selling-campaign consciously.",
        "Now, as for him, he would be willing to leave the whole set-up to the advertising genius of Brother Sarason.",
        "\"No, no, no!\" cried Windrip.",
        "\"We're not ready for a war!",
        "Of course, we'll take Mexico some day.",
        "It's our destiny to control it and Christianize it.",
        "But I'm scared that your darn scheme might work just opposite to what you say.",
        "You put arms into the hands of too many irresponsible folks, and they might use 'em and turn against you and start a revolution and throw the whole dern gang of us out!",
        "No, no!",
        "I've often wondered if the whole Minute Men business, with their arms and training, may not be a mistake.",
        "That was your idea, Lee, not mine!\"\r\n\r\nSarason spoke evenly: \"My dear Buzz, one day you thank me for originating that 'great crusade of citizen soldiers defending their homes'—as you love to call it on the radio—and the next day you almost ruin your clothes, you're so scared of them.",
        "Make up your mind one way or the other!\"\r\n\r\nSarason walked out of the room, not bowing.",
        "Windrip complained, \"I'm not going to stand for Lee's talking to me like that!",
        "Why, the dirty double-crosser, I made him!",
        "One of these days, he'll find a new secretary of state around this joint!",
        "I s'pose he thinks jobs like that grow on every tree!",
        "Maybe he'd like to be a bank president or something—I mean, maybe he'd like to be Emperor of England!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Windrip, in his hotel bedroom, was awakened late at night by the voice of a guard in the outer room: \"Yuh, sure, let him pass—he's the Secretary of State.\" Nervously the President clicked on his bedside lamp...",
        ".",
        "He had needed it lately, to read himself to sleep.",
        "In that limited glow he saw Lee Sarason, Dewey Haik, and Dr.",
        "Hector Macgoblin march to the side of his bed.",
        "Lee's thin sharp face was like flour.",
        "His deep-buried eyes were those of a sleepwalker.",
        "His skinny right hand held a bowie knife which, as his hand deliberately rose, was lost in the dimness.",
        "Windrip swiftly thought: Sure would be hard to know where to buy a dagger, in Washington; and Windrip thought: All this is the doggonedest foolishness—just like a movie or one of these old history books when you were a kid; and Windrip thought, all in that same flash: Good God, I'm going to be killed!",
        "He cried out, \"Lee!",
        "You couldn't do that to me!\"\r\n\r\nLee grunted, like one who has detected a bad smell.",
        "Then the Berzelius Windrip who could, incredibly, become President really awoke: \"Lee!",
        "Do you remember the time when your old mother was so sick, and I gave you my last cent and loaned you my flivver so you could go see her, and I hitch-hiked to my next meeting?",
        "Lee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell.",
        "I suppose so.",
        "General.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" answered Dewey Haik, not very pleasantly.",
        "\"I think we'll stick him on a destroyer or something and let him sneak off to France or England....",
        "The lousy coward seems afraid to die....",
        "Of course, we'll kill him if he ever does dare to come back to the States.",
        "Take him out and phone the Secretary of the Navy for a boat and get him on it, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Haik, even less pleasantly.",
        "It had been easy.",
        "The troops, who obeyed Haik, as Secretary of War, had occupied all of Washington.",
        "Ten days later Buzz Windrip was landed in Havre and went sighingly to Paris.",
        "It was his first view of Europe except for one twenty-one-day Cook's Tour.",
        "He was profoundly homesick for Chesterfield cigarettes, flapjacks, Moon Mullins, and the sound of some real human being saying \"Yuh, what's bitin' you?\" instead of this perpetual sappy \"oui?\"\r\n\r\nIn Paris he remained, though he became the sort of minor hero of tragedy, like the ex-King of Greece, Kerensky, the Russian Grand Dukes, Jimmy Walker, and a few ex-presidents from South America and Cuba, who is delighted to accept invitations to drawing rooms where the champagne is good enough and one may have a chance of finding people, now and then, who will listen to one's story and say \"sir.\"\r\n\r\nAt that, though, Buzz chuckled, he had kinda put it over on those crooks, for during his two sweet years of despotism he had sent four million dollars abroad, to secret, safe accounts.",
        "And so Buzz Windrip passed into wabbly paragraphs in recollections by ex-diplomatic gentlemen with monocles.",
        "In what remained of Ex-President Windrip's life, everything was ex.",
        "He was even so far forgotten that only four or five American students tried to shoot him.",
        "The more dulcetly they had once advised and flattered Buzz, the more ardently did most of his former followers, Macgoblin and Senator Porkwood and Dr.",
        "Almeric Trout and the rest, turn in loud allegiance to the new President, the Hon.",
        "Lee Sarason.",
        "He issued a proclamation that he had discovered that Windrip had been embezzling the people's money and plotting with Mexico to avoid war with that guilty country; and that he, Sarason, in quite alarming grief and reluctance, since he more than anyone else had been deceived by his supposed friend, Windrip, had yielded to the urging of the Cabinet and taken over the Presidency, instead of Vice-President Beecroft, the exiled traitor.",
        "President Sarason immediately began appointing the fancier of his young officer friends to the most responsible offices in State and army.",
        "It amused him, seemingly, to shock people by making a pink-cheeked, moist-eyed boy of twenty-five Commissioner of the Federal District, which included Washington and Maryland.",
        "Was he not supreme, was he not semi-divine, like a Roman emperor?",
        "Could he not defy all the muddy mob that he (once a Socialist) had, for its weak shiftlessness, come to despise?",
        "\"Would that the American people had just one neck!\" he plagiarized, among his laughing boys.",
        "In the decorous White House of Coolidge and Harrison and Rutherford Birchard Hayes he had orgies (an old name for \"parties\") with weaving limbs and garlands and wine in pretty fair imitations of Roman beakers.",
        "It was hard for imprisoned men like Doremus Jessup to believe it, but there were some tens of thousands of Corpos, in the M.M.'s, in civil service, in the army, and just in private ways, to whom Sarason's flippant régime was tragic.",
        "They were the Idealists of Corpoism, and there were plenty of them, along with the bullies and swindlers; they were the men and women who, in 1935 and 1936, had turned to Windrip & Co., not as perfect, but as the most probable saviors of the country from, on one hand, domination by Moscow and, on the other hand, the slack indolence, the lack of decent pride of half the American youth, whose world (these idealists asserted) was composed of shiftless distaste for work and refusal to learn anything thoroughly, of blatting dance music on the radio, maniac automobiles, slobbering sexuality, the humor and art of comic strips—of a slave psychology which was making America a land for sterner men to loot.",
        "General Emmanuel Coon was one of the Corpo Idealists.",
        "Such men did not condone the murders under the Corpo régime.",
        "But they insisted, \"This is a revolution, and after all, when in all history has there been a revolution with so little bloodshed?\"\r\n\r\nThey were aroused by the pageantry of Corpoism: enormous demonstrations, with the red-and-black flags a flaunting magnificence like storm clouds.",
        "They were proud of new Corpo roads, hospitals, television stations, aeroplane lines; they were touched by processions of the Corpo Youth, whose faces were exalted with pride in the myths of Corpo heroism and clean Spartan strength and the semi-divinity of the all-protecting Father, President Windrip.",
        "They believed, they made themselves believe, that in Windrip had come alive again the virtues of Andy Jackson and Farragut and Jeb Stuart, in place of the mob cheapness of the professional athletes who had been the only heroes of 1935.",
        "They planned, these idealists, to correct, as quickly as might be, the errors of brutality and crookedness among officials.",
        "They saw arising a Corpo art, a Corpo learning, profound and real, divested of the traditional snobbishness of the old-time universities, valiant with youth, and only the more beautiful in that it was \"useful.\" They were convinced that Corpoism was Communism cleansed of foreign domination and the violence and indignity of mob dictatorship; Monarchism with the chosen hero of the people for monarch; Fascism without grasping and selfish leaders; freedom with order and discipline; Traditional America without its waste and provincial cockiness.",
        "Like all religious zealots, they had blessed capacity for blindness, and they were presently convinced that (since the only newspapers they ever read certainly said nothing about it) there were no more of blood-smeared cruelties in court and concentration camp; no restrictions of speech or thought.",
        "They believed that they never criticized the Corpo régime not because they were censored, but because \"that sort of thing was, like obscenity, such awfully bad form.\"\r\n\r\nAnd these idealists were as shocked and bewildered by Sarason's coup d'état against Windrip as was Mr.",
        "Berzelius Windrip himself.",
        "The grim Secretary of War, Haik, scolded at President Sarason for his influence on the nation, particularly on the troops.",
        "Lee laughed at him, but once he was sufficiently flattered by Haik's tribute to his artistic powers to write a poem for him.",
        "It was a poem which was later to be sung by millions; it was, in fact, the most popular of the soldiers' ballads which were to spring automatically from anonymous soldier bards during the war between the United States and Mexico.",
        "Only, being as pious a believer in Modern Advertising as Sarason himself, the efficient Haik wanted to encourage the spontaneous generation of these patriotic folk ballads by providing the automatic springing and the anonymous bard.",
        "He had as much foresight, as much \"prophetic engineering,\" as a motorcar manufacturer.",
        "Sarason was as eager for war with Mexico (or Ethiopia or Siam or Greenland or any other country that would provide his pet young painters with a chance to portray Sarason being heroic amid curious vegetation) as Haik; not only to give malcontents something outside the country to be cross about, but also to give himself a chance to be picturesque.",
        "He answered Haik's request by writing a rollicking military chorus at a time while the country was still theoretically entirely friendly with Mexico.",
        "It went to the tune of \"Mademoiselle from Armentières\"—or \"Armenteers.\" If the Spanish in it was a little shaky, still, millions were later to understand that \"Habla oo?\" stood for \"¿Habla usted?\" signifying \"Parlez-vous?\" It ran thus, as it came from Sarason's purple but smoking typewriter:\r\n\r\nSeñorita from Guadalupe,\r\nQui usted?",
        "Señorita go roll your hoop,\r\nOr come to bed!",
        "Señorita from Guadalupe\r\nIf Padre sees us we're in the soup,\r\nHinky, dinky, habla oo?",
        "Señorita from Monterey,\r\nSavvy Yank?",
        "Señorita what's that you say?",
        "You're Swede, Ay tank!",
        "But Señorita from Monterey,\r\nYou won't hablar when we hit the hay,\r\nHinky, dinky, habla oo?",
        "Señorita from Mazatlán,\r\nOnce we've met,\r\nYou'll smile all over your khaki pan,\r\nYou wont forget!",
        "For days you'll holler, \"Oh, what a man!\"\r\nAnd you'll never marry a Mexican.",
        "Hinky, dinky, habla oo?",
        "If at times President Sarason seemed flippant, he was not at all so during his part in the scientific preparation for war which consisted in rehearsing M.M.",
        "choruses in trolling out this ditty with well-trained spontaneity.",
        "His friend Hector Macgoblin, now Secretary of State, told Sarason that this manly chorus was one of his greatest creations.",
        "Macgoblin, though personally he did not join in Sarason's somewhat unusual midnight diversions, was amused by them, and he often told Sarason that he was the only original creative genius among this whole bunch of stuffed shirts, including Haik.",
        "\"You want to watch that cuss Haik, Lee,\" said Macgoblin.",
        "\"He's ambitious, he's a gorilla, and he's a pious Puritan, and that's a triple combination I'm scared of.",
        "The troops like him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rats!",
        "He has no attraction for them.",
        "He's just an accurate military bookkeeper,\" said Sarason.",
        "That night he had a party at which, for a novelty, rather shocking to his intimates, he actually had girls present, performing certain curious dances.",
        "The next morning Haik rebuked him, and—Sarason had a hangover—was stormed at.",
        "That night, just a month after Sarason had usurped the Presidency, Haik struck.",
        "There was no melodramatic dagger-and-uplifted-arm business about it, this time—though Haik did traditionally come late, for all Fascists, like all drunkards, seem to function most vigorously at night.",
        "Haik marched into the White House with his picked storm troops, found President Sarason in violet silk pajamas among his friends, shot Sarason and most of his companions dead, and proclaimed himself President.",
        "Hector Macgoblin fled by aeroplane to Cuba, then on.",
        "When last seen, he was living high up in the mountains of Haiti, wearing only a singlet, dirty white-drill trousers, grass sandals, and a long tan beard; very healthy and happy, occupying a one-room hut with a lovely native girl, practicing modern medicine and studying ancient voodoo.",
        "When Dewey Haik became President, then America really did begin to suffer a little, and to long for the good old democratic, liberal days of Windrip.",
        "Windrip and Sarason had not minded mirth and dancing in the street so long as they could be suitably taxed.",
        "Haik disliked such things on principle.",
        "Except, perhaps, that he was an atheist in theology, he was a strict orthodox Christian.",
        "He was the first to tell the populace that they were not going to get any five thousand dollars a year but, instead, \"reap the profits of Discipline and of the Scientific Totalitarian State not in mere paper figures but in vast dividends of Pride, Patriotism, and Power.\" He kicked out of the army all officers who could not endure marching and going thirsty; and out of the civil branch all commissioners—including one Francis Tasbrough—who had garnered riches too easily and too obviously.",
        "He treated the entire nation like a well-run plantation, on which the slaves were better fed than formerly, less often cheated by their overseers, and kept so busy that they had time only for work and for sleep, and thus fell rarely into the debilitating vices of laughter, song (except war songs against Mexico), complaint, or thinking.",
        "Under Haik there were less floggings in M.M.",
        "posts and in concentration camps, for by his direction officers were not to waste time in the sport of beating persons, men, women, or children, who asserted that they didn't care to be slaves on even the best plantation, but just to shoot them out of hand.",
        "Haik made such use of the clergy—Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Liberal-Agnostic—as Windrip and Sarason never had.",
        "While there were plenty of ministers who, like Mr.",
        "Falck and Father Stephen Perefixe, like Cardinal Faulhaber and Pastor Niemoeller in Germany, considered it some part of Christian duty to resent the enslavement and torture of their appointed flocks, there were also plenty of reverend celebrities, particularly large-city pastors whose sermons were reported in the newspapers every Monday morning, to whom Corpoism had given a chance to be noisily and lucratively patriotic.",
        "These were the chaplains-at-heart, who, if there was no war in which they could humbly help to purify and comfort the poor brave boys who were fighting, were glad to help provide such a war.",
        "These more practical shepherds, since like doctors and lawyers they were able to steal secrets out of the heart, became valued spies during the difficult months after February, 1939, when Haik was working up war with Mexico.",
        "(Canada?",
        "Japan?",
        "Russia?",
        "They would come later.) For even with an army of slaves, it was necessary to persuade them that they were freemen and fighters for the principle of freedom, or otherwise the scoundrels might cross over and join the enemy!",
        "So reigned the good king Haik, and if there was anyone in all the land who was discontented, you never heard him speak—not twice.",
        "And in the White House, where under Sarason shameless youths had danced, under the new reign of righteousness and the blackjack, Mrs.",
        "Haik, a lady with eyeglasses and a smile of resolute cordiality, gave to the W.C.T.U., the Y.W.C.A., and the Ladies' League against Red Radicalism, and their inherently incidental husbands, a magnified and hand-colored Washington version of just such parties as she had once given in the Haik bungalow in Eglantine, Oregon.",
        "CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE ban on information at the Trianon camp had been raised; Mrs.",
        "Candy had come calling on Doremus—complete with cocoanut layer cake—and he had heard of Mary's death, the departure of Emma and Sissy, the end of Windrip and Sarason.",
        "And none of it seemed in the least real—not half so real and, except for the fact that he would never see Mary again, not half so important as the increasing number of lice and rats in their cell.",
        "During the ban, they had celebrated Christmas by laughing, not very cheerfully, at the Christmas tree Karl Pascal had contrived out of a spruce bough and tinfoil from cigarette packages.",
        "They had hummed \"Stille Nacht\" softly in the darkness, and Doremus had thought of all their comrades in political prisons in America, Europe, Japan, India.",
        "But Karl, apparently, thought of comrades only if they were saved, baptized Communists.",
        "And, forced together as they were in a cell, the growing bitterness and orthodox piety of Karl became one of Doremus's most hateful woes; a tragedy to be blamed upon the Corpos, or upon the principle of dictatorship in general, as savagely as the deaths of Mary and Dan Wilgus and Henry Veeder.",
        "Under persecution, Karl lost no ounce of his courage and his ingenuity in bamboozling the M.M.",
        "guards, but day by day he did steadily lose all his humor, his patience, his tolerance, his easy companionship, and everything else that made life endurable to men packed in a cell.",
        "The Communism that had always been his King Charles's Head, sometimes amusing, became a religious bigotry as hateful to Doremus as the old bigotries of the Inquisition or the Fundamentalist Protestants; that attitude of slaughtering to save men's souls from which the Jessup family had escaped during these last three generations.",
        "It was impossible to get away from Karl's increasing zeal.",
        "He chattered on at night for an hour after all the other five had growled, \"Oh, shut up!",
        "I want to sleep!",
        "You'll be making a Corpo out of me!\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, in his proselytizing, he conquered.",
        "When his cell mates had long enough cursed the camp guards, Karl would rebuke them: \"You're a lot too simple when you explain everything by saying that the Corpos, especially the M.M.'s, are all fiends.",
        "Plenty of 'em are.",
        "But even the worst of 'em, even the professional gunmen in the M.M.",
        "ranks, don't get as much satisfaction out of punishing us heretics as the honest, dumb Corpos who've been misled by their leaders' mouthing about Freedom, Order, Security, Discipline, Strength!",
        "All those swell words that even before Windrip came in the speculators started using to protect their profits!",
        "Especially how they used the word 'Liberty'!",
        "Liberty to steal the didies off the babies!",
        "I tell you, an honest man gets sick when he hears the word 'Liberty' today, after what the Republicans did to it!",
        "And I tell you that a lot of the M.M.",
        "guards right here at Trianon are just as unfortunate as we are—lot of 'em are just poor devils that couldn't get decent work, back in the Golden Age of Frank Roosevelt—bookkeepers that had to dig ditches, auto agents that couldn't sell cars and went sour, ex-looeys in the Great War that came back to find their jobs pinched off 'em and that followed Windrip, quite honestly, because they thought, the saps, that when he said Security he meant Security!",
        "They'll learn!\"\r\n\r\nAnd having admirably discoursed for another hour on the perils of self-righteousness among the Corpos, Comrade Pascal would change the subject and discourse upon the glory of self-righteousness among the Communists—particularly upon those sanctified examples of Communism who lived in bliss in the Holy City of Moscow, where, Doremus judged, the streets were paved with undepreciable roubles.",
        "The Holy City of Moscow!",
        "Karl looked upon it with exactly such uncritical and slightly hysterical adoration as other sectarians had in their day devoted to Jerusalem, Mecca, Rome, Canterbury, and Benares.",
        "Fine, all right, thought Doremus.",
        "Let 'em worship their sacred fonts—it was as good a game as any for the mentally retarded.",
        "Only, why then should they object to his considering as sacred Fort Beulah, or New York, or Oklahoma City?",
        "Karl once fell into a froth because Doremus wondered if the iron deposits in Russia were all they might be.",
        "Why certainly!",
        "Russia, being Holy Russia, must, as a useful part of its holiness, have sufficient iron, and Karl needed no mineralogists' reports but only the blissful eye of faith to know it.",
        "He did not mind Karl's worshiping Holy Russia.",
        "But Karl did, using the word \"naïve,\" which is the favorite word and just possibly the only word known to Communist journalists, derisively mind when Doremus had a mild notion of worshiping Holy America.",
        "Karl spoke often of photographs in the Moscow News of nearly naked girls on Russian bathing-beaches as proving the triumph and joy of the workers under Bolshevism, but he regarded precisely the same sort of photographs of nearly naked girls on Long Island bathing-beaches as proving the degeneration of the workers under Capitalism.",
        "As a newspaper man, Doremus remembered that the only reporters who misrepresented and concealed facts more unscrupulously than the Capitalists were the Communists.",
        "He was afraid that the world struggle today was not of Communism against Fascism, but of tolerance against the bigotry that was preached equally by Communism and Fascism.",
        "But he saw too that in America the struggle was befogged by the fact that the worst Fascists were they who disowned the word \"Fascism\" and preached enslavement to Capitalism under the style of Constitutional and Traditional Native American Liberty.",
        "For they were thieves not only of wages but of honor.",
        "To their purpose they could quote not only Scripture but Jefferson.",
        "That Karl Pascal should be turning into a zealot, like most of his chiefs in the Communist party, was grievous to Doremus because he had once simple-heartedly hoped that in the mass strength of Communism there might be an escape from cynical dictatorship.",
        "But he saw now that he must remain alone, a \"Liberal,\" scorned by all the noisier prophets for refusing to be a willing cat for the busy monkeys of either side.",
        "But at worst, the Liberals, the Tolerant, might in the long run preserve some of the arts of civilization, no matter which brand of tyranny should finally dominate the world.",
        "\"More and more, as I think about history,\" he pondered, \"I am convinced that everything that is worth while in the world has been accomplished by the free, inquiring, critical spirit, and that the preservation of this spirit is more important than any social system whatsoever.",
        "But the men of ritual and the men of barbarism are capable of shutting up the men of science and of silencing them forever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, this was the worst thing the enemies of honor, the pirate industrialists and then their suitable successors, the Corpos with their blackjacks, had done: it had turned the brave, the generous, the passionate and half-literate Karl Pascals into dangerous fanatics.",
        "And how well they had done it!",
        "Doremus was uncomfortable with Karl; he felt that his next turn in jail might be under the wardenship of none other than Karl himself, as he remembered how the Bolsheviks, once in power, had most smugly imprisoned and persecuted those great women, Spiridinova and Breshkovskaya and Ismailovitch, who, by their conspiracies against the Czar, their willingness to endure Siberian torture on behalf of \"freedom for the masses,\" had most brought on the revolution by which the Bolsheviks were able to take control—and not only again forbid freedom to the masses, but this time inform them that, anyway, freedom was just a damn silly bourgeois superstition.",
        "So Doremus, sleeping two-and-a-half feet above his old companion, felt himself in a cell within a cell.",
        "Henry Veeder and Clarence Little and Victor Loveland and Mr.",
        "Falck were gone now, and to Julian, penned in solitary, he could not speak once a month.",
        "He yearned for escape with a desire that was near to insanity; awake and asleep it was his obsession; and he thought his heart had stopped when Squad-Leader Aras Dilley muttered to him, as Doremus was scrubbing a lavatory floor, \"Say!",
        "Listen, Mr.",
        "Jessup!",
        "Mis' Pike is fixin' it up and I'm going to help you escape jus' soon as things is right!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a question of the guards on sentry-go outside the quadrangle.",
        "As sweeper, Doremus was reasonably free to leave his cell, and Aras had loosened the boards and barbed wire at the end of one of the alleys leading from the quadrangle between buildings.",
        "But outside, he was likely to be shot by a guard on sight.",
        "For a week Aras watched.",
        "He knew that one of the night guards had a habit of getting drunk, which was forgiven him because of his excellence in flogging troublemakers but which was regarded by the more judicious as rather regrettable.",
        "And for that week Aras fed the guard's habit on Lorinda's expense money, and was indeed so devoted to his duties that he was himself twice carried to bed.",
        "Snake Tizra grew interested—but Snake also, after the first couple of drinks, liked to be democratic with his men and to sing \"The Old Spinning-Wheel.\"\r\n\r\nAras confided to Doremus: \"Mis' Pike—she don't dast send you a note, less somebody get hold of it, but she says to me to tell you not to tell anybody you're going to take a sneak, or it'll get out.\"\r\n\r\nSo on the evening when Aras jerked a head at him from the corridor, then rasped, surly-seeming, \"Here you, Jessup—you left one of the cans all dirty!\" Doremus looked mildly at the cell that had been his home and study and tabernacle for six months, glanced at Karl Pascal reading in his bunk—slowly waving a shoeless foot in a sock with the end of it gone, at Truman Webb darning the seat of his pants, noted the gray smoke in filmy tilting layers about the small electric bulb in the ceiling, and silently stepped out into the corridor.",
        "The late-January night was foggy.",
        "Aras handed him a worn M.M.",
        "overcoat, whispered, \"Third alley on right; moving-van on corner opposite the church,\" and was gone.",
        "On hands and knees Doremus briskly crawled under the loosened barbed wire at the end of the small alley and carelessly stepped out, along the road.",
        "The only guard in sight was at a distance, and he was wavering in his gait.",
        "A block away, a furniture van was jacked up while the driver and his helper painfully prepared to change one of the tremendous tires.",
        "In the light of a corner arc, Doremus saw that the driver was that same hard-faced long-distance cruiser who had carried bundles of tracts for the New Underground.",
        "The driver grunted, \"Get in—hustle!\" Doremus crouched between a bureau and a wing chair inside.",
        "Instantly he felt the tilted body of the van dropping, as the driver pulled out the jack, and from the seat he heard, \"All right!",
        "We're off.",
        "Crawl up behind me here and listen, Mr.",
        "Jessup....",
        "Can you hear me?...",
        "The M.M.'s don't take so much trouble to prevent you gents and respectable fellows from escaping.",
        "They figure that most of you are too scary to try out anything, once you're away from your offices and front porches and sedans.",
        "But I guess you may be different, some ways, Mr.",
        "Jessup.",
        "Besides, they figure that if you do escape, they can pick you up easy afterwards, because you ain't onto hiding out, like a regular fellow that's been out of work sometimes and maybe gone on the bum.",
        "But don't worry.",
        "We'll get you through.",
        "I tell you, there's nobody got friends like a revolutionist....",
        "and enemies!\"\r\n\r\nThen first did it come to Doremus that, by sentence of the late lamented Effingham Swan, he was subject to the death penalty for escaping.",
        "But \"Oh, what the hell!\" he grunted, like Karl Pascal, and he stretched in the luxury of mobility, in that galloping furniture truck.",
        "He was free!",
        "He saw the lights of villages going by!",
        "Once, he was hidden beneath hay in a barn; again, in a spruce grove high on a hill; and once he slept overnight on top of a coffin in the establishment of an undertaker.",
        "He walked secret paths; he rode in the back of an itinerant medicine-peddler's car and, concealed in fur cap and high-collared fur coat, in the sidecar of an Underground worker serving as an M.M.",
        "squad-leader.",
        "From this he dismounted, at the driver's command, in front of an obviously untenanted farmhouse on a snaky back-road between Monadnock Mountain and the Averill lakes—a very slattern of an old unpainted farmhouse, with sinking roof and snow up to the frowsy windows.",
        "It seemed a mistake.",
        "Doremus knocked, as the motorcycle snarled away, and the door opened on Lorinda Pike and Sissy, crying together, \"Oh, my dear!\"\r\n\r\nHe could only mutter, \"Well!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they had made him strip off his fur coat in the farmhouse living room, a room with peeling wall paper, and altogether bare except for a cot, two chairs, a table, the two moaning women saw a small man, his face dirty, pasty, and sunken as by tuberculosis, his once fussily trimmed beard and mustache ragged as wisps of hay, his overlong hair a rustic jag at the back, his clothes ripped and filthy—an old, sick, discouraged tramp.",
        "He dropped on a straight chair and stared at them.",
        "Maybe they were genuine—maybe they really were there—maybe he was, as it seemed, in heaven, looking at the two principal angels, but he had been so often fooled so cruelly in his visions these dreary months!",
        "He sobbed, and they comforted him with softly stroking hands and not too confoundedly much babble.",
        "\"I've got a hot bath for you!",
        "And I'll scrub your back!",
        "And then some hot chicken soup and ice cream!\"\r\n\r\nAs though one should say: The Lord God awaits you on His throne and all whom you bless shall be blessed, and all your enemies brought to their knees!",
        "Those sainted women had actually had a long tin tub fetched to the kitchen of the old house, filled it with water heated in kettle and dishpan on the stove, and provided brushes, soap, a vast sponge, and such a long caressing bath towel as Doremus had forgotten existed.",
        "And somehow, from Fort Beulah, Sissy had brought plenty of his own shoes and shirts and three suits that now seemed to him fit for royalty.",
        "He who had not had a hot bath for six months, and for three had worn the same underclothes, and for two (in clammy winter) no socks whatever!",
        "If the presence of Lorinda and Sissy was token of heaven, to slide inch by slow ecstatic inch into the tub was its proof, and he lay soaking in glory.",
        "When he was half dressed, the two came in, and there was about as much thought of modesty, or need for it, as though he were the two-year-old babe he somewhat resembled.",
        "They were laughing at him, but laughter became sharp whimpers of horror when they saw the gridironed meat of his back.",
        "But nothing more demanding than \"Oh, my dear!\" did Lorinda say, even then.",
        "Though Sissy had once been glad that Lorinda spared her any mothering, Doremus rejoiced in it.",
        "Snake Tizra and the Trianon concentration camp had been singularly devoid of any mothering.",
        "Lorinda salved his back and powdered it.",
        "She cut his hair, not too unskillfully.",
        "She cooked for him all the heavy, earthy dishes of which he had dreamed, hungry in a cell: hamburg steak with onions, corn pudding, buckwheat cakes with sausages, apple dumplings with hard and soft sauce, and cream of mushroom soup!",
        "It had not been safe to take him to the comforts of her tea room at Beecher Falls; already M.M.'s had been there, snooping after him.",
        "But Sissy and she had, for such refugees as they might be forwarding for the New Underground, provided this dingy farmhouse with half-a-dozen cots, and rich stores of canned goods and beautiful bottles (Doremus considered them) of honey and marmalade and bar-le-duc.",
        "The actual final crossing of the border into Canada was easier than it had been when Buck Titus had tried to smuggle the Jessup family over.",
        "It had become a system, as in the piratical days of bootlegging; with new forest paths, bribery of frontier guards, and forged passports.",
        "He was safe.",
        "Yet just to make safety safer, Lorinda and Sissy, rubbing their chins as they looked Doremus over, still discussing him as brazenly as though he were a baby who could not understand them, decided to turn him into a young man.",
        "\"Dye his hair and mustache black and shave the beard, I think.",
        "I wish we had time to give him a nice Florida tan with an Alpine lamp, too,\" considered Lorinda.",
        "\"Yes, I think he'll look sweet that way,\" said Sissy.",
        "\"I will not have my beard off!\" he protested.",
        "\"How do I know what kind of a chin I'll have when it's naked?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the man still thinks he's a newspaper proprietor and one of Fort Beulah's social favorites!\" marveled Sissy as they ruthlessly set to work.",
        "\"Only real reason for these damn wars and revolutions anyway is that the womenfolks get a chance—ouch!",
        "be careful!—to be dear little Amateur Mothers to every male they can get in their clutches.",
        "Hair dye!\" said Doremus bitterly.",
        "But he was shamelessly proud of his youthful face when it was denuded, and he discovered that he had a quite tolerably stubborn chin, and Sissy was sent back to Beecher Falls to keep the tea room alive, and for three days Lorinda and he gobbled steaks and ale, and played pinochle, and lay talking infinitely of all they had thought about each other in the six desert months that might have been sixty years.",
        "He was to remember the sloping farmhouse bedroom and a shred of rag carpet and a couple of rickety chairs and Lorinda snuggled under the old red comforter on the cot, not as winter poverty but as youth and adventurous love.",
        "Then, in a forest clearing, with snow along the spruce boughs, a few feet across into Canada, he was peering into the eyes of his two women, curtly saying good-bye, and trudging off into the new prison of exile from the America to which, already, he was looking back with the long pain of nostalgia.",
        "CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nHIS beard had grown again—he and his beard had been friends for many years, and he had missed it of late.",
        "His hair and mustache had again assumed a respectable gray in place of the purple dye that under electric lights had looked so bogus.",
        "He was no longer impassioned at the sight of a lamb chop or a cake of soap.",
        "But he had not yet got over the pleasure and slight amazement at being able to talk as freely as he would, as emphatically as might please him, and in public.",
        "He sat with his two closest friends in Montreal, two fellow executives in the Department of Propaganda and Publications of the New Underground (Walt Trowbridge, General Chairman), and these two friends were the Hon.",
        "Perley Beecroft, who presumably was the President of the United States, and Joe Elphrey, an ornamental young man who, as \"Mr.",
        "Cailey,\" had been a prize agent of the Communist Party in America till he had been kicked out of that almost imperceptible body for having made a \"united front\" with Socialists, Democrats, and even choir-singers when organizing an anti-Corpo revolt in Texas.",
        "Over their ale, in this café, Beecroft and Elphrey were at it as usual: Elphrey insisting that the only \"solution\" of American distress was dictatorship by the livelier representatives of the toiling masses, strict and if need be violent, but (this was his new heresy) not governed by Moscow.",
        "Beecroft was gaseously asserting that \"all we needed\" was a return to precisely the political parties, the drumming up of votes, and the oratorical legislating by Congress, of the contented days of William B.",
        "McKinley.",
        "But as for Doremus, he leaned back not vastly caring what nonsense the others might talk so long as it was permitted them to talk at all without finding that the waiters were M.M.",
        "spies; and content to know that, whatever happened, Trowbridge and the other authentic leaders would never go back to satisfaction in government of the profits, by the profits, for the profits.",
        "He thought comfortably of the fact that just yesterday (he had this from the chairman's secretary), Walt Trowbridge had dismissed Wilson J.",
        "Shale, the ducal oil man, who had come, apparently with sincerity, to offer his fortune and his executive experience to Trowbridge and the cause.",
        "\"Nope.",
        "Sorry, Will.",
        "But we can't use you.",
        "Whatever happens—even if Haik marches over and slaughters all of us along with all our Canadian hosts—you and your kind of clever pirates are finished.",
        "Whatever happens, whatever details of a new system of government may be decided on, whether we call it a 'Cooperative Commonwealth' or 'State Socialism' or 'Communism' or 'Revived Traditional Democracy,' there's got to be a new feeling—that government is not a game for a few smart, resolute athletes like you, Will, but a universal partnership, in which the State must own all resources so large that they affect all members of the State, and in which the one worst crime won't be murder or kidnaping but taking advantage of the State—in which the seller of fraudulent medicine, or the liar in Congress, will be punished a whole lot worse than the fellow who takes an ax to the man who's grabbed off his girl....",
        "Eh?",
        "What's going to happen to magnates like you, Will?",
        "God knows!",
        "What happened to the dinosaurs?\"\r\n\r\nSo was Doremus in his service well content.",
        "Yet socially he was almost as lonely as in his cell at Trianon; almost as savagely he longed for the not exorbitant pleasure of being with Lorinda, Buck, Emma, Sissy, Steve Perefixe.",
        "None of them save Emma could join him in Canada, and she would not.",
        "Her letters suggested fear of the un-Worcesterian wildernesses of Montreal.",
        "She wrote that Philip and she hoped they might be able to get Doremus forgiven by the Corpos!",
        "So he was left to associate only with his fellow refugees from Corpoism, and he knew a life that had been familiar, far too familiar, to political exiles ever since the first revolt in Egypt sent the rebels sneaking off into Assyria.",
        "It was no particularly indecent egotism in Doremus that made him suppose, when he arrived in Canada, that everyone would thrill to his tale of imprisonment, torture, and escape.",
        "But he found that ten thousand spirited tellers of woe had come there before him, and that the Canadians, however attentive and generous hosts they might be, were actively sick of pumping up new sympathy.",
        "They felt that their quota of martyrs was completely filled, and as to the exiles who came in penniless, and that was a majority of them, the Canadians became distinctly weary of depriving their own families on behalf of unknown refugees, and they couldn't even keep up forever a gratification in the presence of celebrated American authors, politicians, scientists, when they became common as mosquitoes.",
        "It was doubtful if a lecture on Deplorable Conditions in America by Herbert Hoover and General Pershing together would have attracted forty people.",
        "Ex-governors and judges were glad to get jobs washing dishes, and ex-managing-editors were hoeing turnips.",
        "And reports said that Mexico and London and France were growing alike apologetically bored.",
        "So Doremus, meagerly living on his twenty-dollar-a-week salary from the N.U., met no one save his own fellow exiles, in just such salons of unfortunate political escapists as the White Russians, the Red Spaniards, the Blue Bulgarians, and all the other polychromatic insurrectionists frequented in Paris.",
        "They crowded together, twenty of them in a parlor twelve by twelve, very like the concentration-camp cells in area, inhabitants, and eventual smell, from 8 P.M.",
        "till midnight, and made up for lack of dinner with coffee and doughnuts and exiguous sandwiches, and talked without cessation about the Corpos.",
        "They told as \"actual facts\" stories about President Haik which had formerly been applied to Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini—the one about the man who was alarmed to find he had saved Haik from drowning and begged him not to tell.",
        "In the cafés they seized the newspapers from home.",
        "Men who had had an eye gouged out on behalf of freedom, with the rheumy remaining one peered to see who had won the Missouri Avenue Bridge Club Prize.",
        "They were brave and romantic, tragic and distinguished, and Doremus became a little sick of them all and of the final brutality of fact that no normal man can very long endure another's tragedy, and that friendly weeping will some day turn to irritated kicking.",
        "He was stirred when, in a hastily built American interdenominational chapel, he heard a starveling who had once been a pompous bishop read from the pine pulpit:\r\n\r\n\"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.",
        "We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof....",
        "How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?",
        "If I forget thee O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.",
        "If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.\"\r\n\r\nHere in Canada the Americans had their Weeping Wall and daily cried with false, gallant hope, \"Next year in Jerusalem!\"\r\n\r\nSometimes Doremus was vexed by the ceaseless demanding wails of refugees who had lost everything, sons and wives and property and self-respect, vexed that they believed they alone had seen such horrors; and sometimes he spent all his spare hours raising a dollar and a little weary friendliness for these sick souls; and sometimes he saw as fragments of Paradise every aspect of America— such oddly assorted glimpses as Meade at Gettysburg and the massed blue petunias in Emma's lost garden, the fresh shine of rails as seen from a train on an April morning and Rockefeller Center.",
        "But whatever his mood, he refused to sit down with his harp by any foreign waters whatever and enjoy the importance of being a celebrated beggar.",
        "He'd get back to America and chance another prison.",
        "Meantime he neatly sent packages of literary dynamite out from the N.U.",
        "offices all day long, and efficiently directed a hundred envelope-addressers who once had been professors and pastrycooks.",
        "He had asked his superior, Perley Beecroft, for assignment in more active and more dangerous work, as secret agent in America—out West, where he was not known.",
        "But headquarters had suffered a good deal from amateur agents who babbled to strangers, or who could not be trusted to keep their mouths shut while they were being flogged to death.",
        "Things had changed since 1929.",
        "The N.U.",
        "believed that the highest honor a man could earn was not to have a million dollars but to be permitted to risk his life for truth, without pay or praise.",
        "Doremus knew that his chiefs did not consider him young enough or strong enough, but also that they were studying him.",
        "Twice he had the honor of interviews with Trowbridge about nothing in particular—surely it must have been an honor, though it was hard to remember it, because Trowbridge was the simplest and friendliest man in the whole portentous spy machine.",
        "Cheerfully Doremus hoped for a chance to help make the poor, overworked, worried Corpo officials even more miserable than they normally were, now that war with Mexico and revolts against Corpoism were jingling side by side.",
        "In July, 1939, when Doremus had been in Montreal a little over five months, and a year after his sentence to concentration camp, the American newspapers which arrived at N.U.",
        "headquarters were full of resentment against Mexico.",
        "Bands of Mexicans had raided across into the United States—always, curiously enough, when our troops were off in the desert, practice-marching or perhaps gathering sea shells.",
        "They burned a town in Texas—fortunately all the women and children were away on a Sunday-school picnic, that afternoon.",
        "A Mexican Patriot (aforetime he had also worked as an Ethiopian Patriot, a Chinese Patriot, and a Haitian Patriot) came across, to the tent of an M.M.",
        "brigadier, and confessed that while it hurt him to tattle on his own beloved country, conscience compelled him to reveal that his Mexican superiors were planning to fly over and bomb Laredo, San Antonio, Bisbee, and probably Tacoma, and Bangor, Maine.",
        "This excited the Corpo newspapers very much indeed and in New York and Chicago they published photographs of the conscientious traitor half an hour after he had appeared at the Brigadier's tent...",
        "where, at that moment, forty-six reporters happened to be sitting about on neighboring cactuses.",
        "America rose to defend her hearthstones, including all the hearthstones on Park Avenue, New York, against false and treacherous Mexico, with its appalling army of 67,000 men, with thirty-nine military aeroplanes.",
        "Women in Cedar Rapids hid under the bed; elderly gentlemen in Cattaraugus County, New York, concealed their money in elm-tree boles; and the wife of a chicken- raiser seven miles N.E.",
        "of Estelline, South Dakota, a woman widely known as a good cook and a trained observer, distinctly saw a file of ninety-two Mexican soldiers pass her cabin, starting at 3:17 A.M.",
        "on July 27, 1939.",
        "To answer this threat, America, the one country that had never lost a war and never started an unjust one, rose as one man, as the Chicago Daily Evening Corporate put it.",
        "It was planned to invade Mexico as soon as it should be cool enough, or even earlier, if the refrigeration and air-conditioning could be arranged.",
        "In one month, five million men were drafted for the invasion, and started training.",
        "Thus—perhaps too flippantly—did Joe Cailey and Doremus discuss the declaration of war against Mexico.",
        "If they found the whole crusade absurd, it may be stated in their defense that they regarded all wars always as absurd; in the baldness of the lying by both sides about the causes; in the spectacle of grown-up men engaged in the infantile diversions of dressing-up in fancy clothes and marching to primitive music.",
        "The only thing not absurd about wars, said Doremus and Cailey, was that along with their skittishness they did kill a good many millions of people.",
        "Ten thousand starving babies seemed too high a price for a Sam Browne belt for even the sweetest, touchingest young lieutenant.",
        "Yet both Doremus and Cailey swiftly recanted their assertion that all wars were absurd and abominable; both of them made exception of the people's wars against tyranny, as suddenly America's agreeable anticipation of stealing Mexico was checked by a popular rebellion against the whole Corpo régime.",
        "The revolting section was, roughly, bounded by Sault Ste.",
        "Marie, Detroit, Cincinnati, Wichita, San Francisco, and Seattle, though in that territory large patches remained loyal to President Haik, and outside of it, other large patches joined the rebels.",
        "It was the part of America which had always been most \"radical\"—that indefinite word, which probably means \"most critical of piracy.\" It was the land of the Populists, the Non-Partisan League, the Farmer-Labor Party, and the La Follettes—a family so vast as to form a considerable party in itself.",
        "Whatever might happen, exulted Doremus, the revolt proved that belief in America and hope for America were not dead.",
        "These rebels had most of them, before his election, believed in Buzz Windrip's fifteen points; believed that when he said he wanted to return the power pilfered by the bankers and the industrialists to the people, he more or less meant that he wanted to return the power of the bankers and industrialists to the people.",
        "As month by month they saw that they had been cheated with marked cards again, they were indignant; but they were busy with cornfield and sawmill and dairy and motor factory, and it took the impertinent idiocy of demanding that they march down into the desert and help steal a friendly country to jab them into awakening and into discovering that, while they had been asleep, they had been kidnaped by a small gang of criminals armed with high ideals, well-buttered words and a lot of machine guns.",
        "So profound was the revolt that the Catholic Archbishop of California and the radical Ex-Governor of Minnesota found themselves in the same faction.",
        "At first it was a rather comic outbreak—comic as the ill-trained, un-uniformed, confusedly thinking revolutionists of Massachusetts in 1776.",
        "President General Haik publicly jeered at them as a \"ridiculous rag-tag rebellion of hoboes too lazy to work.\" And at first they were unable to do anything more than scold like a flock of crows, throw bricks at detachments of M.M.'s and policemen, wreck troop trains, and destroy the property of such honest private citizens as owned Corpo newspapers.",
        "It was in August that the shock came, when General Emmanuel Coon, Chief of Staff of the regulars, flew from Washington to St.",
        "Paul, took command of Fort Snelling, and declared for Walt Trowbridge as Temporary President of the United States, to hold office until there should be a new, universal, and uncontrolled presidential election.",
        "Trowbridge proclaimed acceptance—with the proviso that he should not be a candidate for permanent President.",
        "By no means all of the regulars joined Coon's revolutionary troops.",
        "(There are two sturdy myths among the Liberals: that the Catholic Church is less Puritanical and always more esthetic than the Protestant; and that professional soldiers hate war more than do congressmen and old maids.) But there were enough regulars who were fed up with the exactions of greedy, mouth-dripping Corpo commissioners and who threw in with General Coon so that immediately after his army of regulars and hastily trained Minnesota farmers had won the battle of Mankato, the forces at Leavenworth took control of Kansas City, and planned to march on St.",
        "Louis and Omaha; while in New York, Governor's Island and Fort Wadsworth looked on, neutral, as unmilitary-looking and mostly Jewish guerrillas seized the subways, power stations, and railway terminals.",
        "But there the revolt halted, because in the America, which had so warmly praised itself for its \"widespread popular free education,\" there had been so very little education, widespread, popular, free, or anything else, that most people did not know what they wanted— indeed knew about so few things to want at all.",
        "There had been plenty of schoolrooms; there had been lacking only literate teachers and eager pupils and school boards who regarded teaching as a profession worthy of as much honor and pay as insurance-selling or embalming or waiting on table.",
        "Most Americans had learned in school that God had supplanted the Jews as chosen people by the Americans, and this time done the job much better, so that we were the richest, kindest, and cleverest nation living; that depressions were but passing headaches and that labor unions must not concern themselves with anything except higher wages and shorter hours and, above all, must not set up an ugly class struggle by combining politically; that, though foreigners tried to make a bogus mystery of them, politics were really so simple that any village attorney or any clerk in the office of a metropolitan sheriff was quite adequately trained for them; and that if John D.",
        "Rockefeller or Henry Ford had set his mind to it, he could have become the most distinguished statesman, composer, physicist, or poet in the land.",
        "Even two-and-half years of despotism had not yet taught most electors humility, nor taught them much of anything except that it was unpleasant to be arrested too often.",
        "So, after the first gay eruption of rioting, the revolt slowed up.",
        "Neither the Corpos nor many of their opponents knew enough to formulate a clear, sure theory of self-government, or irresistibly resolve to engage in the sore labor of fitting themselves for freedom....",
        "Even yet, after Windrip, most of the easy-going descendants of the wisecracking Benjamin Franklin had not learned that Patrick Henry's \"Give me liberty or give me death\" meant anything more than a high-school yell or a cigarette slogan.",
        "The followers of Trowbridge and General Coon—\"The American Cooperative Commonwealth\" they began to call themselves—did not lose any of the territory they had seized; they held it, driving out all Corpo agents, and now and then added a county or two.",
        "But mostly their rule, and equally the Corpos' rule, was as unstable as politics in Ireland.",
        "So the task of Walt Trowbridge, which in August had seemed finished, before October seemed merely to have begun.",
        "Doremus Jessup was called into Trowbridge's office, to hear from the chairman:\r\n\r\n\"I guess the time's come when we need Underground agents in the States with sense as well as guts.",

        "Good luck, Brother Jessup!",
        "Try to persuade the orators that are still holding out for Discipline and clubs that they ain't so much stalwart as funny!\"\r\n\r\nAnd all that Doremus thought was, \"Kind of a nice fellow, Trowbridge.",
        "Glad to be working with him,\" as he set off on his new task of being a spy and professional hero without even any funny passwords to make the game romantic.",
        "CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nHIS packing was done.",
        "It had been very simple, since his kit consisted only of toilet things, one change of clothes, and the first volume of Spengler's Decline of the West.",
        "He was waiting in his hotel lobby for time to take the train to Winnipeg.",
        "He was interested by the entrance of a lady more decorative than the females customarily seen in this modest inn: a hand-tooled presentation copy of a lady, in crushed levant and satin doublure; a lady with mascara'd eyelashes, a permanent wave, and a cobweb frock.",
        "She ambled through the lobby and leaned against a fake-marble pillar, wielding a long cigarette-holder and staring at Doremus.",
        "She seemed amused by him, for no clear reason.",
        "Could she be some sort of Corpo spy?",
        "She lounged toward him, and he realized that she was Lorinda Pike.",
        "While he was still gasping, she chuckled, \"Oh, no, darling, I'm not so realistic in my art as to carry out this rôle too far!",
        "It just happens to be the easiest disguise to win over the Corpo frontier guards—if you'll agree it really is a disguise!\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her with a fury which shocked the respectable hostelry.",
        "She knew, from N.U.",
        "agents, that he was going out into a very fair risk of being flogged to death.",
        "She had come solely to say farewell and bring him what might be his last budget of news.",
        "Buck was in concentration camp—he was more feared and more guarded than Doremus had been, and Linda had not been able to buy him out.",
        "Julian, Karl, and John Pollikop were still alive, still imprisoned.",
        "Father Perefixe was running the N.U.",
        "cell in Fort Beulah, but slightly confused because he wanted to approve of war with Mexico, a nation which he detested for its treatment of Catholic priests.",
        "Lorinda and he had, apparently, fought bloodily all one evening about Catholic rule in Latin America.",
        "As is always typical of Liberals, Lorinda managed to speak of Father Perefixe at once with virtuous loathing and the greatest affection.",
        "Emma and David were reported as well content in Worcester, though there were murmurs that Philip's wife did not too thankfully receive her mother-in-law's advice on cooking.",
        "Sissy was becoming a deft agitator who still, remembering that she was a born architect, drew plans for houses that Julian and she would some day adorn.",
        "She contrived blissfully to combine assaults on all Capitalism with an entirely capitalistic conception of the year-long honeymoons Julian and she were going to have.",
        "Less surprising than any of this were the tidings that Francis Tasbrough, very beautiful in repentance, had been let out of the Corpo prison to which he had been sent for too much grafting and was again a district commissioner, well thought of, and that his housekeeper was now Mrs.",

        "She turned away from him and raced down the station platform too quickly.",
        "She had lost all her confident pose of flip elegance.",
        "Leaning out from the vestibule he saw her stop at the gate, diffidently raise her hand as if to wave at the long anonymity of the train windows, then shakily march away through the gates.",

        "He went down to breakfast, cheerfully rubbing his hands.",
        "He consumed grapefruit and porridge—but without sugar: there was an embargo on sugar.",
        "He looked down and inspected himself; he sighed, \"I'm getting too much of a pod, with all this outdoor work and being so hungry; I've got to cut down on the grub\"; and then he consumed fried eggs, bacon, toast, coffee made of acorns, and marmalade made of carrots—Coon's troops had shut off coffee beans and oranges.",
        "He read, meantime, the Minneapolis Daily Corporate.",
        "It announced a Great Victory in Mexico—in the same place, he noted, in which there had already been three Great Victories in the past two weeks.",
        "Also, a \"shameful rebellion\" had been put down in Andalusia, Alabama; it was reported that General Göring was coming over to be the guest of President Haik; and the pretender Trowbridge was said \"by a reliable source\" to have been assassinated, kidnaped, and compelled to resign.",

        "As he came out of the hotel, a squad of Minute Men were marching by.",
        "They were farm boys, newly recruited for service in Mexico; they looked as scared and soft and big-footed as a rout of rabbits.",
        "They tried to pipe up the newest-oldest war song, in the manner of the Civil War ditty \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again\":\r\n\r\nWhen Johnny comes home from Greaser Land,\r\nHurray, hurraw,\r\nHis ears will be full of desert sand,\r\nHurray, hurraw,\r\nBut he'll speaka de Spiggoty pretty sweet\r\nAnd he'll bring us a gun and a señorit',\r\nAnd we'll all get stewed when\r\nJohnny comes marching home!",

        "If he missed the strong hills behind Fort Beulah, he was yet exalted by the immensity of the sky, the openness of prairie that promised he could go on forever, the gayety of small sloughs seen through their fringes of willows and cottonwoods, and once, aspiring overhead, an early flight of mallards.",
        "He whistled boisterously as he bounced on along the section-line road.",
        "He reached a gaunt yellow farmhouse—it was to have had a porch, but there was only an unpainted nothingness low down on the front wall to show where the porch would be.",
        "To a farmer who was oiling a tractor in the pig-littered farmyard he chirped, \"Name's William Barton Dobbs—representing the Des Moines Combine and Up-to-Date Implement Company.\"\r\n\r\nThe farmer galloped up to shake hands, breathing, \"By golly this is a great honor, Mr.",

        "'Scuse me.\"\r\n\r\nIn an upper bedroom of the farmhouse, seven men were waiting, perched on chair and table and edges of the bed, or just squatted on the floor.",

        "Now I wonder if you're ready with your reports?\"\r\n\r\nTo the agent whose difficulty in converting farm-owners had been their dread of paying decent wages to farm hands, Doremus presented for use the argument (as formalized yet passionate as the observations of a life-insurance agent upon death by motor accident) that poverty for one was poverty for all....",
        "It wasn't such a very new argument, nor so very logical, but it had been a useful carrot for many human mules.",
        "For the agent among the Finnish-American settlers, who were insisting that Trowbridge was a Bolshevik and just as bad as the Russians, Doremus had a mimeographed quotation from the Izvestia of Moscow damning Trowbridge as a \"social Fascist quack.\" For the Bavarian farmers down the other way, who were still vaguely pro-Nazi, Doremus had a German émigré paper published in Prague, proving (though without statistics or any considerable quotation from official documents) that, by agreement with Hitler, President Haik was, if he remained in power, going to ship back to the German Army all German-Americans with so much as one grandparent born in the Fatherland.",

        "Oh dear!",
        "I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\r\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\r\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\r\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\r\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\r\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\r\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\r\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.",
        "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\r\nin the world she was to get out again.",
        "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\r\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\r\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\r\ndeep well.",
        "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\r\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\r\nwas going to happen next.",
        "First, she tried to look down and make out\r\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\r\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\r\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\r\nhung upon pegs.",
        "She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\r\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\r\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\r\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\r\ncupboards as she fell past it.",
        "“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\r\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs!",
        "How brave they’ll all think me\r\nat home!",
        "Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\r\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\r\n\r\nDown, down, down.",
        "Would the fall _never_ come to an end?",
        "“I wonder how\r\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud.",
        "“I must be\r\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth.",
        "Let me see: that would\r\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\r\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\r\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\r\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\r\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\r\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\r\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\r\ngrand words to say.)\r\n\r\nPresently she began again.",
        "“I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\r\nthe earth!",
        "How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\r\nwith their heads downward!",
        "The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\r\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\r\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\r\ncountry is, you know.",
        "Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\r\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\r\nfalling through the air!",
        "Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\r\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking!",
        "No, it’ll never do\r\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\r\n\r\nDown, down, down.",
        "There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\r\ntalking again.",
        "“Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\r\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\r\ntea-time.",
        "Dinah my dear!",
        "I wish you were down here with me!",
        "There are\r\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\r\nvery like a mouse, you know.",
        "But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\r\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\r\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats?",
        "Do cats eat bats?” and\r\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\r\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it.",
        "She felt\r\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\r\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\r\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\r\nthump!",
        "thump!",
        "down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\r\nthe fall was over.",
        "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\r\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\r\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\r\nit.",
        "There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\r\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\r\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\r\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\r\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\r\nfrom the roof.",
        "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\r\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\r\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\r\nget out again.",
        "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\r\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\r\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\r\nbut, alas!",
        "either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\r\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them.",
        "However, on the second\r\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\r\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\r\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",
        "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\r\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\r\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.",
        "How she longed to get\r\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\r\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\r\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\r\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders.",
        "Oh,\r\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope!",
        "I think I could, if I only\r\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\r\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\r\nindeed were really impossible.",
        "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\r\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\r\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\r\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\r\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\r\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\r\nletters.",
        "It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\r\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry.",
        "“No, I’ll look first,” she said,\r\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\r\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\r\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\r\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\r\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\r\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\r\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\r\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\r\nsooner or later.",
        "However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\r\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\r\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\r\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.",
        "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\r\ntelescope.”\r\n\r\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\r\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\r\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden.",
        "First, however, she\r\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\r\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\r\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle.",
        "I\r\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\r\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\r\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.",
        "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\r\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!",
        "when she got to the\r\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\r\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\r\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\r\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\r\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\r\nsat down and cried.",
        "“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\r\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\r\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\r\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\r\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\r\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\r\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.",
        "“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\r\npeople!",
        "Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\r\nperson!”\r\n\r\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\r\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\r\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants.",
        "“Well, I’ll eat it,” said\r\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\r\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\r\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\r\n\r\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way?",
        "Which\r\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\r\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\r\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\r\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\r\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\r\non in the common way.",
        "So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",
        "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.",
        "The Pool of Tears\r\n\r\n\r\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\r\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\r\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was!",
        "Good-bye, feet!”\r\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\r\nsight, they were getting so far off).",
        "“Oh, my poor little feet, I\r\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?",
        "I’m\r\nsure _I_ shan’t be able!",
        "I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\r\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\r\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\r\nwant to go!",
        "Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\r\nChristmas.”\r\n\r\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.",
        "“They must\r\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\r\npresents to one’s own feet!",
        "And how odd the directions will look!",
        "_Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\r\n     Alice’s love_).",
        "Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\r\n\r\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\r\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\r\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.",
        "Poor Alice!",
        "It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\r\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\r\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.",
        "“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\r\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way!",
        "Stop\r\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\r\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\r\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.",
        "After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\r\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.",
        "It was the White\r\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\r\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\r\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh!",
        "the Duchess, the\r\nDuchess!",
        "Oh!",
        "won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\r\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\r\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\r\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\r\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.",
        "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\r\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear!",
        "How\r\nqueer everything is to-day!",
        "And yesterday things went on just as usual.",
        "I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night?",
        "Let me think: was I the\r\nsame when I got up this morning?",
        "I almost think I can remember feeling\r\na little different.",
        "But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\r\nin the world am I?",
        "Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\r\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\r\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.",
        "“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\r\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\r\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!",
        "she knows such a\r\nvery little!",
        "Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\r\npuzzling it all is!",
        "I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.",
        "Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\r\nand four times seven is—oh dear!",
        "I shall never get to twenty at that\r\nrate!",
        "However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\r\nGeography.",
        "London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\r\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain!",
        "I must have been\r\nchanged for Mabel!",
        "I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\r\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\r\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\r\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\r\n\r\n“How doth the little crocodile\r\n    Improve his shining tail,\r\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\r\n    On every golden scale!",
        "“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\r\n    How neatly spread his claws,\r\nAnd welcome little fishes in\r\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\r\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\r\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\r\nno toys to play with, and oh!",
        "ever so many lessons to learn!",
        "No, I’ve\r\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here!",
        "It’ll be\r\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\r\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then?",
        "Tell me that first, and\r\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\r\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\r\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down!",
        "I am so\r\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\r\n\r\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\r\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\r\nshe was talking.",
        "“How _can_ I have done that?” she thought.",
        "“I must be\r\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\r\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\r\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\r\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\r\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",
        "“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\r\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\r\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\r\ndoor: but, alas!",
        "the little door was shut again, and the little golden\r\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\r\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\r\nbefore, never!",
        "And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\r\n\r\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\r\nsplash!",
        "she was up to her chin in salt water.",
        "Her first idea was that\r\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\r\nrailway,” she said to herself.",
        "(Alice had been to the seaside once in\r\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\r\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\r\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\r\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\r\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\r\nshe was nine feet high.",
        "“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\r\nto find her way out.",
        "“I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\r\nbeing drowned in my own tears!",
        "That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\r\nsure!",
        "However, everything is queer to-day.”\r\n\r\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\r\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\r\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\r\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\r\nslipped in like herself.",
        "“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?",
        "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\r\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\r\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?",
        "I am very tired\r\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\r\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\r\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\r\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\r\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\r\nbut it said nothing.",
        "“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\r\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\r\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\r\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\r\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book.",
        "The Mouse gave a\r\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\r\nfright.",
        "“Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\r\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings.",
        "“I quite forgot you didn’t like\r\ncats.”\r\n\r\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.",
        "“Would\r\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\r\nabout it.",
        "And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\r\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her.",
        "She is such a dear\r\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\r\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\r\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\r\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\r\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\r\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended.",
        "“We won’t talk\r\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\r\n\r\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\r\ntail.",
        "“As if _I_ would talk on such a subject!",
        "Our family always\r\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!",
        "Don’t let me hear the name\r\nagain!”\r\n\r\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\r\nconversation.",
        "“Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\r\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\r\nour house I should like to show you!",
        "A little bright-eyed terrier, you\r\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair!",
        "And it’ll fetch things when\r\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\r\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\r\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds!",
        "He says\r\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\r\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\r\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\r\npool as it went.",
        "So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear!",
        "Do come back again, and we\r\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\r\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\r\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\r\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\r\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\r\n\r\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\r\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\r\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.",
        "Alice\r\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",
        "CHAPTER III.",
        "A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\r\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\r\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",
        "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\r\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\r\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\r\nshe had known them all her life.",
        "Indeed, she had quite a long argument\r\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\r\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\r\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\r\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.",
        "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\r\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!",
        "_I’ll_ soon make\r\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\r\nMouse in the middle.",
        "Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\r\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.",
        "“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready?",
        "This\r\nis the driest thing I know.",
        "Silence all round, if you please!",
        "‘William\r\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\r\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\r\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest.",
        "Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\r\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.",
        "“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\r\nyou speak?”\r\n\r\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.",
        "“I thought you did,” said the Mouse.",
        "“—I proceed.",
        "‘Edwin and Morcar,\r\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\r\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\r\n\r\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.",
        "“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\r\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\r\n\r\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\r\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm.",
        "The question is, what did the\r\narchbishop find?”\r\n\r\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\r\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\r\nthe crown.",
        "William’s conduct at first was moderate.",
        "But the insolence\r\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\r\nturning to Alice as it spoke.",
        "“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\r\ndry me at all.”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\r\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\r\nremedies—”\r\n\r\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet.",
        "“I don’t know the meaning of half\r\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\r\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\r\ntittered audibly.",
        "“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\r\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\r\n\r\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\r\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\r\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.",
        "“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\r\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\r\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\r\n\r\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\r\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\r\nalong the course, here and there.",
        "There was no “One, two, three, and\r\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\r\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.",
        "However,\r\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\r\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\r\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\r\n\r\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\r\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\r\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\r\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.",
        "At last the Dodo\r\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\r\n\r\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.",
        "“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\r\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\r\nconfused way, “Prizes!",
        "Prizes!”\r\n\r\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\r\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\r\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes.",
        "There was exactly\r\none a-piece, all round.",
        "“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.",
        "“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely.",
        "“What else have you got in\r\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.",
        "“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.",
        "“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.",
        "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\r\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\r\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\r\ncheered.",
        "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\r\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\r\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\r\nshe could.",
        "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\r\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\r\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.",
        "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\r\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.",
        "“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\r\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\r\nwould be offended again.",
        "“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\r\nsighing.",
        "“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\r\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\r\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\r\ntale was something like this:—\r\n\r\n         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\r\n         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\r\n         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\r\n         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\r\n         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\r\n         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\r\n         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\r\n\r\n“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely.",
        "“What are\r\nyou thinking of?”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\r\nbend, I think?”\r\n\r\n“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.",
        "“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\r\nanxiously about her.",
        "“Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\r\n\r\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\r\nwalking away.",
        "“You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice.",
        "“But you’re so easily offended,\r\nyou know!”\r\n\r\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.",
        "“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\r\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\r\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.",
        "“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\r\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\r\nher daughter “Ah, my dear!",
        "Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\r\n_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\r\nsnappishly.",
        "“You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\r\n\r\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\r\naddressing nobody in particular.",
        "“She’d soon fetch it back!”\r\n\r\n“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\r\nLory.",
        "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\r\n“Dinah’s our cat.",
        "And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\r\ncan’t think!",
        "And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!",
        "Why,\r\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\r\n\r\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.",
        "Some of the\r\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\r\ncarefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\r\ndoesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\r\nto its children, “Come away, my dears!",
        "It’s high time you were all in\r\nbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\r\nalone.",
        "“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\r\ntone.",
        "“Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\r\ncat in the world!",
        "Oh, my dear Dinah!",
        "I wonder if I shall ever see you\r\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\r\nlonely and low-spirited.",
        "In a little while, however, she again heard a\r\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\r\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\r\ncoming back to finish his story.",
        "CHAPTER IV.",
        "The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\r\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\r\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess!",
        "The Duchess!",
        "Oh my dear paws!",
        "Oh\r\nmy fur and whiskers!",
        "She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\r\nferrets!",
        "Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\r\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\r\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\r\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\r\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\r\nlittle door, had vanished completely.",
        "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\r\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\r\ndoing out here?",
        "Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\r\na fan!",
        "Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\r\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\r\nmistake it had made.",
        "“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran.",
        "“How\r\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am!",
        "But I’d better take him\r\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\r\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\r\nplate with the name “W.",
        "RABBIT,” engraved upon it.",
        "She went in without\r\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\r\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\r\nfan and gloves.",
        "“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\r\na rabbit!",
        "I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\r\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice!",
        "Come\r\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\r\nnurse!",
        "But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\r\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\r\nif it began ordering people about like that!”\r\n\r\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\r\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\r\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\r\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\r\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass.",
        "There was no label\r\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\r\nand put it to her lips.",
        "“I know _something_ interesting is sure to\r\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\r\nI’ll just see what this bottle does.",
        "I do hope it’ll make me grow large\r\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\r\n\r\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\r\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\r\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.",
        "She hastily put\r\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\r\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\r\ndrunk quite so much!”\r\n\r\nAlas!",
        "it was too late to wish that!",
        "She went on growing, and growing,\r\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\r\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\r\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.",
        "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\r\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\r\ncan do no more, whatever happens.",
        "What _will_ become of me?”\r\n\r\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\r\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\r\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\r\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.",
        "“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\r\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\r\nrabbits.",
        "I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\r\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life!",
        "I do wonder what\r\n_can_ have happened to me!",
        "When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\r\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\r\none!",
        "There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!",
        "And\r\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\r\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\r\n\r\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\r\nnow?",
        "That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\r\nthen—always to have lessons to learn!",
        "Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself.",
        "“How can you learn\r\nlessons in here?",
        "Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\r\nfor any lesson-books!”\r\n\r\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\r\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\r\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.",
        "“Mary Ann!",
        "Mary Ann!” said the voice.",
        "“Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\r\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.",
        "Alice knew it was\r\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\r\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\r\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.",
        "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\r\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\r\nthat attempt proved a failure.",
        "Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\r\ngo round and get in at the window.”\r\n\r\n“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\r\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\r\nhand, and made a snatch in the air.",
        "She did not get hold of anything,\r\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\r\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\r\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.",
        "Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat!",
        "Pat!",
        "Where are you?” And\r\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here!",
        "Digging\r\nfor apples, yer honour!”\r\n\r\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily.",
        "“Here!",
        "Come and\r\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\r\n\r\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\r\n\r\n“An arm, you goose!",
        "Who ever saw one that size?",
        "Why, it fills the whole\r\nwindow!”\r\n\r\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\r\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\r\nall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\r\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air.",
        "This time there were\r\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass.",
        "“What a number\r\nof cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice.",
        "“I wonder what\r\nthey’ll do next!",
        "As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\r\n_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\r\n\r\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\r\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\r\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\r\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!",
        "fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\r\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh!",
        "they’ll do\r\nwell enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill!",
        "catch hold of this\r\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!",
        "Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\r\nfancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t!",
        "_You_ do\r\nit!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill!",
        "the master says\r\nyou’re to go down the chimney!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!",
        "So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\r\nherself.",
        "“Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!",
        "I wouldn’t be in\r\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\r\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\r\n\r\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\r\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\r\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\r\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\r\nto see what would happen next.",
        "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\r\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\r\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\r\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow?",
        "What happened to you?",
        "Tell\r\nus all about it!”\r\n\r\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\r\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\r\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\r\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\r\n\r\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.",
        "“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\r\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\r\nwonder what they _will_ do next!",
        "If they had any sense, they’d take the\r\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\r\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\r\n\r\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\r\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\r\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face.",
        "“I’ll put a stop to\r\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\r\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.",
        "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\r\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\r\nhead.",
        "“If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\r\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\r\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\r\nbegan shrinking directly.",
        "As soon as she was small enough to get\r\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\r\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside.",
        "The poor little Lizard, Bill,\r\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\r\nsomething out of a bottle.",
        "They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\r\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\r\nsafe in a thick wood.",
        "“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\r\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\r\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.",
        "I think that\r\nwill be the best plan.”\r\n\r\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\r\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\r\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\r\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\r\ngreat hurry.",
        "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\r\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.",
        "“Poor little\r\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\r\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\r\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\r\nspite of all her coaxing.",
        "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\r\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\r\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\r\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\r\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\r\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\r\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\r\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\r\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\r\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\r\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\r\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\r\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.",
        "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\r\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\r\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.",
        "“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\r\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\r\nleaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\r\nonly been the right size to do it!",
        "Oh dear!",
        "I’d nearly forgotten that\r\nI’ve got to grow up again!",
        "Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed?",
        "I\r\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\r\nquestion is, what?”\r\n\r\nThe great question certainly was, what?",
        "Alice looked all round her at\r\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\r\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.",
        "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\r\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\r\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\r\nwas on the top of it.",
        "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\r\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\r\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\r\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\r\nanything else.",
        "CHAPTER V.",
        "Advice from a Caterpillar\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\r\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\r\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.",
        "“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.",
        "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.",
        "Alice replied,\r\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\r\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\r\nchanged several times since then.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly.",
        "“Explain\r\nyourself!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\r\nnot myself, you see.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\r\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\r\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\r\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\r\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\r\nqueer, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\r\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\r\n\r\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously.",
        "“Who are _you?_”\r\n\r\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.",
        "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\r\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\r\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\r\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\r\nstate of mind, she turned away.",
        "“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her.",
        "“I’ve something\r\nimportant to say!”\r\n\r\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.",
        "“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\r\ncould.",
        "“No,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\r\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.",
        "For\r\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\r\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\r\nthink you’re changed, do you?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\r\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\r\n\r\n“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\r\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.",
        "“Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice folded her hands, and began:—\r\n\r\n“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\r\n    “And your hair has become very white;\r\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\r\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\r\n\r\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\r\n    “I feared it might injure the brain;\r\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\r\n    Why, I do it again and again.”\r\n\r\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\r\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\r\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\r\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\r\n\r\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\r\n    “I kept all my limbs very supple\r\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\r\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\r\n\r\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\r\n    For anything tougher than suet;\r\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\r\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\r\n\r\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\r\n    And argued each case with my wife;\r\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\r\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\r\n\r\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\r\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\r\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\r\n    What made you so awfully clever?”\r\n\r\n“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\r\n    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!",
        "Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?",
        "Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\r\nwords have got altered.”\r\n\r\n“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\r\nand there was silence for some minutes.",
        "The Caterpillar was the first to speak.",
        "“What size do you want to be?” it asked.",
        "“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\r\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\r\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.",
        "“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\r\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\r\n\r\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\r\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).",
        "“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.",
        "And she\r\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\r\noffended!”\r\n\r\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\r\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.",
        "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.",
        "In a\r\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\r\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself.",
        "Then it got down off the\r\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\r\n“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\r\ngrow shorter.”\r\n\r\n“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\r\nherself.",
        "“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\r\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",
        "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\r\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\r\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.",
        "However, at\r\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\r\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.",
        "“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\r\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\r\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!",
        "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\r\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\r\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit.",
        "Her chin was pressed\r\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\r\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\r\nlefthand bit.",
        "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\r\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\r\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\r\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\r\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.",
        "“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice.",
        "“And where _have_ my\r\nshoulders got to?",
        "And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\r\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\r\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",
        "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\r\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\r\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.",
        "She\r\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\r\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\r\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\r\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\r\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.",
        "“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.",
        "“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly.",
        "“Let me alone!”\r\n\r\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\r\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\r\nseems to suit them!”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.",
        "“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\r\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\r\nserpents!",
        "There’s no pleasing them!”\r\n\r\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\r\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.",
        "“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\r\n“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!",
        "Why, I\r\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\r\n\r\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\r\nsee its meaning.",
        "“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\r\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\r\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\r\nfrom the sky!",
        "Ugh, Serpent!”\r\n\r\n“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice.",
        "“I’m a—I’m a—”\r\n\r\n“Well!",
        "_What_ are you?” said the Pigeon.",
        "“I can see you’re trying to\r\ninvent something!”\r\n\r\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\r\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.",
        "“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\r\ncontempt.",
        "“I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\r\n_one_ with such a neck as that!",
        "No, no!",
        "You’re a serpent; and there’s\r\nno use denying it.",
        "I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\r\ntasted an egg!”\r\n\r\n“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\r\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\r\nthey’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\r\n\r\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\r\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\r\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\r\nme whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\r\n\r\n“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\r\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\r\n_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\r\n\r\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\r\ndown again into its nest.",
        "Alice crouched down among the trees as well\r\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\r\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.",
        "After a while\r\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\r\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\r\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\r\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.",
        "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\r\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\r\nand began talking to herself, as usual.",
        "“Come, there’s half my plan\r\ndone now!",
        "How puzzling all these changes are!",
        "I’m never sure what I’m\r\ngoing to be, from one minute to another!",
        "However, I’ve got back to my\r\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\r\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\r\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.",
        "“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\r\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\r\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\r\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",
        "CHAPTER VI.",
        "Pig and Pepper\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\r\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\r\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\r\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\r\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.",
        "It was opened by\r\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\r\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\r\nall over their heads.",
        "She felt very curious to know what it was all\r\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.",
        "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\r\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\r\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess.",
        "An invitation from the\r\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\r\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.",
        "An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\r\n\r\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.",
        "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\r\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\r\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\r\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.",
        "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",
        "“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\r\ntwo reasons.",
        "First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\r\nare; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\r\npossibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\r\nnoise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\r\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\r\npieces.",
        "“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\r\n\r\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\r\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us.",
        "For instance,\r\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\r\nknow.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\r\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil.",
        "“But perhaps he can’t help it,”\r\nshe said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\r\nhead.",
        "But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\r\nshe repeated, aloud.",
        "“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\r\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\r\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.",
        "“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\r\nas if nothing had happened.",
        "“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.",
        "“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman.",
        "“That’s the first\r\nquestion, you know.”\r\n\r\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.",
        "“It’s really\r\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.",
        "It’s enough to drive one crazy!”\r\n\r\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\r\nremark, with variations.",
        "“I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\r\ndays and days.”\r\n\r\n“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.",
        "“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.",
        "“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\r\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.",
        "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\r\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\r\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\r\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.",
        "“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\r\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.",
        "There was certainly too much of it in the air.",
        "Even the Duchess sneezed\r\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\r\nalternately without a moment’s pause.",
        "The only things in the kitchen\r\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\r\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",
        "“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\r\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\r\nyour cat grins like that?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why.",
        "Pig!”\r\n\r\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\r\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\r\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\r\nknow that cats _could_ grin.”\r\n\r\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\r\npleased to have got into a conversation.",
        "“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\r\n\r\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\r\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.",
        "While she\r\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\r\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\r\nthe Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\r\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.",
        "The Duchess took no notice of\r\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\r\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.",
        "“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\r\nin an agony of terror.",
        "“Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\r\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\r\noff.",
        "“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\r\ngrowl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\r\n\r\n“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\r\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.",
        "“Just\r\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night!",
        "You see the\r\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\r\n\r\n“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\r\n\r\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\r\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\r\nbe listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\r\nis it twelve?",
        "I—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\r\nfigures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\r\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\r\nthe end of every line:\r\n\r\n“Speak roughly to your little boy,\r\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\r\nHe only does it to annoy,\r\n    Because he knows it teases.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHORUS.",
        "(In which the cook and the baby joined):\r\n\r\n\r\n“Wow!",
        "wow!",
        "wow!”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\r\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\r\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:—\r\n\r\n“I speak severely to my boy,\r\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\r\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\r\n    The pepper when he pleases!”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHORUS.",
        "“Wow!",
        "wow!",
        "wow!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here!",
        "you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,\r\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke.",
        "“I must go and get ready to play\r\ncroquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room.",
        "The cook\r\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.",
        "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\r\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\r\n“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice.",
        "The poor little thing was\r\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\r\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\r\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",
        "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\r\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\r\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\r\nout into the open air.",
        "“If I don’t take this child away with me,”\r\nthought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\r\nmurder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\r\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).",
        "“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\r\nexpressing yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\r\nto see what was the matter with it.",
        "There could be no doubt that it had\r\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\r\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\r\nnot like the look of the thing at all.",
        "“But perhaps it was only\r\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\r\nwere any tears.",
        "No, there were no tears.",
        "“If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\r\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you.",
        "Mind\r\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\r\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",
        "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\r\nwith this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\r\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.",
        "This time\r\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\r\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\r\nfurther.",
        "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\r\ntrot away quietly into the wood.",
        "“If it had grown up,” she said to\r\nherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\r\nrather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\r\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\r\nto herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\r\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\r\na tree a few yards off.",
        "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.",
        "It looked good-natured, she\r\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\r\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.",
        "“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\r\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\r\nwider.",
        "“Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.",
        "“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\r\n\r\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.",
        "“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.",
        "“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.",
        "“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.",
        "“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\r\nquestion.",
        "“What sort of people live about here?”\r\n\r\n“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\r\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\r\nMarch Hare.",
        "Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.",
        "“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here.",
        "I’m mad.",
        "You’re mad.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.",
        "“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\r\n\r\nAlice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\r\ndo you know that you’re mad?”\r\n\r\n“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad.",
        "You grant that?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” said Alice.",
        "“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\r\nand wags its tail when it’s pleased.",
        "Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\r\nand wag my tail when I’m angry.",
        "Therefore I’m mad.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.",
        "“Call it what you like,” said the Cat.",
        "“Do you play croquet with the\r\nQueen to-day?”\r\n\r\n“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.",
        "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\r\nthings happening.",
        "While she was looking at the place where it had been,\r\nit suddenly appeared again.",
        "“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat.",
        "“I’d nearly\r\nforgotten to ask.”\r\n\r\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\r\nin a natural way.",
        "“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.",
        "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\r\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\r\nwhich the March Hare was said to live.",
        "“I’ve seen hatters before,” she\r\nsaid to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\r\nperhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\r\nwas in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\r\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.",
        "“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.",
        "“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\r\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\r\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\r\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.",
        "“Well!",
        "I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\r\ngrin without a cat!",
        "It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\r\n\r\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\r\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\r\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.",
        "It\r\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\r\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\r\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\r\ntimidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!",
        "I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.",
        "A Mad Tea-Party\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\r\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\r\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\r\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.",
        "“Very\r\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\r\nI suppose it doesn’t mind.”\r\n\r\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\r\none corner of it: “No room!",
        "No room!” they cried out when they saw\r\nAlice coming.",
        "“There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\r\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.",
        "“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.",
        "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.",
        "“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.",
        "“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.",
        "“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.",
        "“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\r\nthe March Hare.",
        "“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\r\nmany more than three.”\r\n\r\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter.",
        "He had been looking at\r\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\r\nspeech.",
        "“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\r\nseverity; “it’s very rude.”\r\n\r\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\r\nwas, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\r\n\r\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice.",
        "“I’m glad they’ve\r\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.",
        "“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\r\nthe March Hare.",
        "“Exactly so,” said Alice.",
        "“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.",
        "“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\r\nsay—that’s the same thing, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter.",
        "“You might just as well\r\nsay that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\r\n\r\n“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\r\nI get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\r\n\r\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\r\ntalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\r\nas ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\r\n\r\n“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\r\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\r\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\r\nwriting-desks, which wasn’t much.",
        "The Hatter was the first to break the silence.",
        "“What day of the month\r\nis it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\r\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\r\nand holding it to his ear.",
        "Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\r\n\r\n“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter.",
        "“I told you butter wouldn’t suit\r\nthe works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.",
        "“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.",
        "“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\r\n“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\r\n\r\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\r\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\r\nnothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.",
        "“What a\r\nfunny watch!” she remarked.",
        "“It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\r\ntell what o’clock it is!”\r\n\r\n“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter.",
        "“Does _your_ watch tell you what\r\nyear it is?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\r\nstays the same year for such a long time together.”\r\n\r\n“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.",
        "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.",
        "The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\r\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.",
        "“I don’t quite\r\nunderstand you,” she said, as politely as she could.",
        "“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\r\nhot tea upon its nose.",
        "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\r\neyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\r\n\r\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\r\nagain.",
        "“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.",
        "“Nor I,” said the March Hare.",
        "Alice sighed wearily.",
        "“I think you might do something better with the\r\ntime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\r\nanswers.”\r\n\r\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\r\nabout wasting _it_.",
        "It’s _him_.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.",
        "“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\r\ncontemptuously.",
        "“I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\r\ntime when I learn music.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!",
        "that accounts for it,” said the Hatter.",
        "“He won’t stand beating.",
        "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\r\nyou liked with the clock.",
        "For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\r\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\r\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling!",
        "Half-past one,\r\ntime for dinner!”\r\n\r\n(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\r\n\r\n“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\r\nshouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\r\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.”\r\n\r\n“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.",
        "The Hatter shook his head mournfully.",
        "“Not I!” he replied.",
        "“We\r\nquarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\r\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\r\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\r\n\r\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!",
        "How I wonder what you’re at!’\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know the song, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.",
        "“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\r\n\r\n‘Up above the world you fly,\r\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.",
        "Twinkle, twinkle—’”\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\r\n“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\r\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.",
        "“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\r\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time!",
        "Off with his\r\nhead!’”\r\n\r\n“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.",
        "“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\r\ndo a thing I ask!",
        "It’s always six o’clock now.”\r\n\r\nA bright idea came into Alice’s head.",
        "“Is that the reason so many\r\ntea-things are put out here?” she asked.",
        "“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\r\nand we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\r\n\r\n“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.",
        "“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\r\n\r\n“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\r\nto ask.",
        "“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.",
        "“I’m getting tired of this.",
        "I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\r\nproposal.",
        "“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried.",
        "“Wake up, Dormouse!” And\r\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.",
        "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.",
        "“I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\r\nhoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\r\n\r\n“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.",
        "“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.",
        "“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\r\nbefore it’s done.”\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\r\nin a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\r\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—”\r\n\r\n“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\r\nin questions of eating and drinking.",
        "“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\r\ntwo.",
        "“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\r\n“they’d have been ill.”\r\n\r\n“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\r\n\r\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\r\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\r\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?”\r\n\r\n“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.",
        "“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\r\ntake more.”\r\n\r\n“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\r\ntake _more_ than nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.",
        "“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.",
        "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\r\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\r\nrepeated her question.",
        "“Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\r\nsaid, “It was a treacle-well.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\r\nHatter and the March Hare went “Sh!",
        "sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\r\nremarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again.",
        "I\r\ndare say there may be _one_.”\r\n\r\n“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly.",
        "However, he consented to\r\ngo on.",
        "“And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\r\nyou know—”\r\n\r\n“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.",
        "“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.",
        "“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\r\non.”\r\n\r\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\r\nmoved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\r\nplace of the March Hare.",
        "The Hatter was the only one who got any\r\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\r\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.",
        "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\r\ncautiously: “But I don’t understand.",
        "Where did they draw the treacle\r\nfrom?”\r\n\r\n“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\r\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\r\n\r\n“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\r\nto notice this last remark.",
        "“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\r\n\r\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\r\nsome time without interrupting it.",
        "“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\r\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\r\nthings—everything that begins with an M—”\r\n\r\n“Why with an M?” said Alice.",
        "“Why not?” said the March Hare.",
        "Alice was silent.",
        "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\r\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\r\nlittle shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\r\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\r\nthings are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\r\ndrawing of a muchness?”\r\n\r\n“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\r\nthink—”\r\n\r\n“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.",
        "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\r\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\r\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\r\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\r\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\r\nthe teapot.",
        "“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her\r\nway through the wood.",
        "“It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\r\nall my life!”\r\n\r\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\r\nleading right into it.",
        "“That’s very curious!” she thought.",
        "“But\r\neverything’s curious today.",
        "I think I may as well go in at once.” And\r\nin she went.",
        "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\r\nglass table.",
        "“Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\r\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\r\nled into the garden.",
        "Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\r\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\r\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\r\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\r\nand the cool fountains.",
        "CHAPTER VIII.",
        "The Queen’s Croquet-Ground\r\n\r\n\r\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\r\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\r\npainting them red.",
        "Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\r\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\r\none of them say, “Look out now, Five!",
        "Don’t go splashing paint over me\r\nlike that!”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\r\nelbow.”\r\n\r\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five!",
        "Always lay the\r\nblame on others!”\r\n\r\n“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five.",
        "“I heard the Queen say only\r\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\r\n\r\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.",
        "“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.",
        "“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\r\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\r\n\r\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\r\nthings—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\r\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\r\nand all of them bowed low.",
        "“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\r\npainting those roses?”\r\n\r\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.",
        "Two began in a low\r\nvoice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\r\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\r\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.",
        "So\r\nyou see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\r\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\r\nout “The Queen!",
        "The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\r\nthemselves flat upon their faces.",
        "There was a sound of many footsteps,\r\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",
        "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\r\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\r\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\r\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.",
        "After these came\r\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\r\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\r\nornamented with hearts.",
        "Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\r\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\r\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\r\nby without noticing her.",
        "Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\r\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\r\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.",
        "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\r\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\r\nof such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\r\nprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\r\nfaces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\r\nand waited.",
        "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\r\nat her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\r\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.",
        "“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\r\nAlice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\r\n\r\n“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\r\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\r\nall.",
        "I needn’t be afraid of them!”\r\n\r\n“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\r\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\r\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\r\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\r\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.",
        "“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage.",
        "“It’s\r\nno business of _mine_.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\r\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head!",
        "Off—”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\r\nsilent.",
        "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\r\ndear: she is only a child!”\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\r\nthem over!”\r\n\r\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.",
        "“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\r\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\r\nthe royal children, and everybody else.",
        "“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen.",
        "“You make me giddy.” And then,\r\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\r\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\r\n\r\n“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.",
        "“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\r\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\r\nto Alice for protection.",
        "“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\r\nflower-pot that stood near.",
        "The three soldiers wandered about for a\r\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\r\nothers.",
        "“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.",
        "“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\r\nin reply.",
        "“That’s right!” shouted the Queen.",
        "“Can you play croquet?”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\r\nevidently meant for her.",
        "“Yes!” shouted Alice.",
        "“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\r\nwondering very much what would happen next.",
        "“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side.",
        "She was\r\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.",
        "“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!",
        "Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.",
        "He looked\r\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\r\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\r\nsentence of execution.”\r\n\r\n“What for?” said Alice.",
        "“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.",
        "“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity.",
        "I said\r\n‘What for?’”\r\n\r\n“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began.",
        "Alice gave a little\r\nscream of laughter.",
        "“Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\r\ntone.",
        "“The Queen will hear you!",
        "You see, she came rather late, and the\r\nQueen said—”\r\n\r\n“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\r\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\r\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\r\nbegan.",
        "Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\r\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\r\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\r\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",
        "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\r\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\r\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\r\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\r\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\r\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\r\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\r\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\r\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\r\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\r\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\r\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\r\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.",
        "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\r\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\r\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\r\nshouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\r\nminute.",
        "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\r\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\r\n“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me?",
        "They’re dreadfully\r\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\r\none left alive!”\r\n\r\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\r\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\r\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\r\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\r\nto herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\r\nto.”\r\n\r\n“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\r\nenough for it to speak with.",
        "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.",
        "“It’s no use\r\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\r\nof them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\r\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\r\nshe had someone to listen to her.",
        "The Cat seemed to think that there\r\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",
        "“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\r\ncomplaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\r\noneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\r\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\r\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\r\narch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\r\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\r\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!”\r\n\r\n“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.",
        "“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\r\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\r\n“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.",
        "“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\r\nlooking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.",
        "“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\r\nintroduce it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\r\nkiss my hand if it likes.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.",
        "“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\r\nthat!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.",
        "“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice.",
        "“I’ve read that in some book,\r\nbut I don’t remember where.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\r\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear!",
        "I wish you would\r\nhave this cat removed!”\r\n\r\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\r\nsmall.",
        "“Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.",
        "“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\r\nhurried off.",
        "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\r\non, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\r\npassion.",
        "She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\r\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\r\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\r\nwhether it was her turn or not.",
        "So she went in search of her hedgehog.",
        "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\r\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\r\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\r\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\r\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",
        "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\r\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\r\nmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\r\nof the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\r\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\r\nfriend.",
        "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\r\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\r\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\r\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.",
        "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\r\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\r\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\r\nwhat they said.",
        "The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\r\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\r\nthing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.",
        "The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\r\nbeheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.",
        "The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\r\nless than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round.",
        "(It was\r\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\r\nanxious.)\r\n\r\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\r\nDuchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”\r\n\r\n“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\r\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.",
        "The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\r\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\r\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\r\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.",
        "CHAPTER IX.",
        "The Mock Turtle’s Story\r\n\r\n\r\n“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”\r\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,\r\nand they walked off together.",
        "Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\r\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\r\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.",
        "“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\r\ntone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_.",
        "Soup\r\ndoes very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\r\nhot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\r\nkind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\r\nthem bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\r\nsweet-tempered.",
        "I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\r\nso stingy about it, you know—”\r\n\r\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\r\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear.",
        "“You’re thinking\r\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.",
        "I can’t\r\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\r\na bit.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.",
        "“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess.",
        "“Everything’s got a moral, if only\r\nyou can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\r\nshe spoke.",
        "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\r\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\r\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\r\nuncomfortably sharp chin.",
        "However, she did not like to be rude, so she\r\nbore it as well as she could.",
        "“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\r\nthe conversation a little.",
        "“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,\r\n’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\r\n\r\n“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\r\ntheir own business!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well!",
        "It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\r\nsharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\r\n_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\r\nthemselves.’”\r\n\r\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\r\nherself.",
        "“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\r\nthe Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\r\nthe temper of your flamingo.",
        "Shall I try the experiment?”\r\n\r\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\r\nto have the experiment tried.",
        "“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite.",
        "And\r\nthe moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\r\n\r\n“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.",
        "“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\r\nputting things!”\r\n\r\n“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.",
        "“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\r\neverything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.",
        "And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\r\nof yours.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\r\nremark, “it’s a vegetable.",
        "It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\r\nis—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\r\nsimply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\r\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\r\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\r\notherwise.’”\r\n\r\n“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\r\n“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\r\nin a pleased tone.",
        "“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\r\nAlice.",
        "“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess.",
        "“I make you a present\r\nof everything I’ve said as yet.”\r\n\r\n“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice.",
        "“I’m glad they don’t give\r\nbirthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\r\nloud.",
        "“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\r\nlittle chin.",
        "“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\r\nfeel a little worried.",
        "“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\r\nthe m—”\r\n\r\nBut here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\r\neven in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\r\nlinked into hers began to tremble.",
        "Alice looked up, and there stood the\r\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\r\nthunderstorm.",
        "“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.",
        "“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\r\nground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\r\nabout half no time!",
        "Take your choice!”\r\n\r\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.",
        "“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\r\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\r\ncroquet-ground.",
        "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\r\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\r\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\r\nwould cost them their lives.",
        "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\r\nwith the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\r\nher head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\r\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\r\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\r\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\r\nand under sentence of execution.",
        "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have\r\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Alice.",
        "“I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.",
        "“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.",
        "“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”\r\n\r\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\r\nto the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\r\ngood thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\r\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.",
        "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.",
        "(If\r\nyou don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\r\nthing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\r\nTurtle, and to hear his history.",
        "I must go back and see after some\r\nexecutions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\r\nwith the Gryphon.",
        "Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\r\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\r\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.",
        "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\r\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled.",
        "“What fun!” said the Gryphon,\r\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.",
        "“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.",
        "“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon.",
        "“It’s all her fancy, that: they never\r\nexecutes nobody, you know.",
        "Come on!”\r\n\r\n“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\r\nafter it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\r\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\r\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.",
        "She\r\npitied him deeply.",
        "“What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\r\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\r\nhis fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know.",
        "Come on!”\r\n\r\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\r\nfull of tears, but said nothing.",
        "“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\r\nhistory, she do.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\r\ndown, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\r\n\r\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.",
        "Alice thought to\r\nherself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\r\nBut she waited patiently.",
        "“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\r\nTurtle.”\r\n\r\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\r\noccasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\r\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.",
        "Alice was very nearly getting up and\r\nsaying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\r\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\r\nnothing.",
        "“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\r\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\r\nsea.",
        "The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\r\n\r\n“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.",
        "“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\r\nangrily: “really you are very dull!”\r\n\r\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\r\nquestion,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\r\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.",
        "At last the\r\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow!",
        "Don’t be all\r\nday about it!” and he went on in these words:\r\n\r\n“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\r\n\r\n“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.",
        "“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.",
        "The Mock Turtle went on.",
        "“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\r\n\r\n“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\r\nproud as all that.”\r\n\r\n“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.",
        "“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\r\n\r\n“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.",
        "“Ah!",
        "then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\r\ntone of great relief.",
        "“Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\r\n‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\r\nof the sea.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.",
        "“I\r\nonly took the regular course.”\r\n\r\n“What was that?” inquired Alice.",
        "“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\r\nreplied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\r\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\r\n\r\n“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say.",
        "“What is it?”\r\n\r\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.",
        "“What!",
        "Never heard of\r\nuglifying!” it exclaimed.",
        "“You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\r\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.”\r\n\r\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\r\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\r\nsubjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\r\nSeaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\r\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\r\nFainting in Coils.”\r\n\r\n“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.",
        "“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\r\nstiff.",
        "And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\r\nthough.",
        "He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\r\n\r\n“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\r\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.”\r\n\r\n“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\r\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.",
        "“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\r\nto change the subject.",
        "“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\r\non.”\r\n\r\n“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.",
        "“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\r\n“because they lessen from day to day.”\r\n\r\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\r\nbefore she made her next remark.",
        "“Then the eleventh day must have been\r\na holiday?”\r\n\r\n“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.",
        "“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\r\ndecided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.",
        "The Lobster Quadrille\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\r\nhis eyes.",
        "He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\r\ntwo sobs choked his voice.",
        "“Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\r\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\r\nthe back.",
        "At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\r\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:—\r\n\r\n“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\r\nAlice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\r\n(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\r\nsaid “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\r\nLobster Quadrille is!”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” said Alice.",
        "“What sort of a dance is it?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\r\nsea-shore—”\r\n\r\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle.",
        "“Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\r\nthen, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\r\n\r\n“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.",
        "“—you advance twice—”\r\n\r\n“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.",
        "“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\r\n\r\n“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.",
        "“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\r\n\r\n“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.",
        "“—as far out to sea as you can—”\r\n\r\n“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.",
        "“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\r\nabout.",
        "“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.",
        "“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\r\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\r\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\r\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.",
        "“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.",
        "“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“Very much indeed,” said Alice.",
        "“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\r\nGryphon.",
        "“We can do without lobsters, you know.",
        "Which shall sing?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon.",
        "“I’ve forgotten the words.”\r\n\r\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\r\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\r\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\r\nand sadly:—\r\n\r\n“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.",
        "“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.",
        "See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!",
        "They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?",
        "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?",
        "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?",
        "“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\r\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\r\nBut the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\r\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.",
        "Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.",
        "Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.",
        "“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.",
        "“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.",
        "The further off from England the nearer is to France—\r\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.",
        "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?",
        "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\r\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\r\ncurious song about the whiting!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\r\nof course?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\r\nhastily.",
        "“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\r\nseen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\r\n\r\n“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully.",
        "“They have their tails in\r\ntheir mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\r\n\r\n“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\r\nall wash off in the sea.",
        "But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\r\nand the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\r\neyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.",
        "“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\r\nlobsters to the dance.",
        "So they got thrown out to sea.",
        "So they had to\r\nfall a long way.",
        "So they got their tails fast in their mouths.",
        "So they\r\ncouldn’t get them out again.",
        "That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting.",
        "I never knew so much\r\nabout a whiting before.”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon.",
        "“Do you\r\nknow why it’s called a whiting?”\r\n\r\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice.",
        "“Why?”\r\n\r\n“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.",
        "Alice was thoroughly puzzled.",
        "“Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\r\nin a wondering tone.",
        "“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon.",
        "“I mean, what\r\nmakes them so shiny?”\r\n\r\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\r\nanswer.",
        "“They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\r\n\r\n“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\r\n“are done with a whiting.",
        "Now you know.”\r\n\r\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.",
        "“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\r\n“any shrimp could have told you that.”\r\n\r\n“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\r\nrunning on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\r\nplease: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\r\n\r\n“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\r\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.",
        "“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\r\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.",
        "“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.",
        "And\r\nthe Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\r\n\r\n“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\r\nAlice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\r\nbecause I was a different person then.”\r\n\r\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“No, no!",
        "The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\r\n“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\r\n\r\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\r\nsaw the White Rabbit.",
        "She was a little nervous about it just at first,\r\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\r\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\r\nwent on.",
        "Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\r\nabout her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\r\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\r\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.",
        "“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.",
        "“I\r\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now.",
        "Tell her to\r\nbegin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\r\nauthority over Alice.",
        "“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the\r\nGryphon.",
        "“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”\r\nthought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got\r\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\r\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\r\nvery queer indeed:—\r\n\r\n“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\r\n“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\r\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\r\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\r\n\r\n[later editions continued as follows\r\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\r\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\r\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\r\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said\r\nthe Gryphon.",
        "“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds\r\nuncommon nonsense.”\r\n\r\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\r\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.",
        "“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily.",
        "“Go on with the next\r\nverse.”\r\n\r\n“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted.",
        "“How _could_ he turn\r\nthem out with his nose, you know?”\r\n\r\n“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully\r\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.",
        "“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it\r\nbegins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”\r\n\r\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\r\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—\r\n\r\n“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\r\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”\r\n\r\n[later editions continued as follows\r\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\r\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.",
        "When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\r\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\r\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\r\nAnd concluded the banquet—]\r\n\r\n\r\n“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle\r\ninterrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on?",
        "It’s by far the\r\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was\r\nonly too glad to do so.",
        "“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon\r\nwent on.",
        "“Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice\r\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\r\n“Hm!",
        "No accounting for tastes!",
        "Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old\r\nfellow?”\r\n\r\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\r\nwith sobs, to sing this:—\r\n\r\n“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\r\nWaiting in a hot tureen!",
        "Who for such dainties would not stoop?",
        "Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!",
        "Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!",
        "Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!",
        "Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!",
        "Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,\r\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!",
        "“Beautiful Soup!",
        "Who cares for fish,\r\nGame, or any other dish?",
        "Who would not give all else for two p\r\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?",
        "Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?",
        "Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!",
        "Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!",
        "Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,\r\n    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\r\nto repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the\r\ndistance.",
        "“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\r\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.",
        "“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\r\nanswered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\r\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—\r\n\r\n“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,\r\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.",
        "Who Stole the Tarts?",
        "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\r\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little\r\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\r\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\r\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\r\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.",
        "In the very middle of the\r\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\r\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\r\nget the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\r\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\r\neverything about her, to pass away the time.",
        "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\r\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\r\nthe name of nearly everything there.",
        "“That’s the judge,” she said to\r\nherself, “because of his great wig.”\r\n\r\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\r\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\r\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.",
        "“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\r\n(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\r\nanimals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\r\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\r\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\r\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.",
        "However, “jury-men”\r\nwould have done just as well.",
        "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.",
        "“What are\r\nthey doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon.",
        "“They can’t have anything\r\nto put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\r\n\r\n“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\r\n“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”\r\n\r\n“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\r\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\r\ncourt!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\r\nto make out who was talking.",
        "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\r\nthat all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\r\nand she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\r\n“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.",
        "“A nice\r\nmuddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.",
        "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.",
        "This of course, Alice\r\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\r\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away.",
        "She did it so quickly\r\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\r\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\r\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\r\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.",
        "“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.",
        "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\r\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—\r\n\r\n“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\r\n    All on a summer day:\r\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\r\n    And took them quite away!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.",
        "“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted.",
        "“There’s a great\r\ndeal to come before that!”\r\n\r\n“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\r\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\r\n\r\nThe first witness was the Hatter.",
        "He came in with a teacup in one hand\r\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.",
        "“I beg pardon, your\r\nMajesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\r\nmy tea when I was sent for.”\r\n\r\n“You ought to have finished,” said the King.",
        "“When did you begin?”\r\n\r\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\r\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.",
        "“Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\r\nwas,” he said.",
        "“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.",
        "“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.",
        "“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\r\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\r\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.",
        "“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.",
        "“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.",
        "“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\r\na memorandum of the fact.",
        "“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none\r\nof my own.",
        "I’m a hatter.”\r\n\r\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\r\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.",
        "“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\r\nhave you executed on the spot.”\r\n\r\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\r\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\r\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\r\nbread-and-butter.",
        "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\r\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\r\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\r\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\r\nas long as there was room for her.",
        "“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\r\nnext to her.",
        "“I can hardly breathe.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.",
        "“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\r\nthat ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\r\nto the other side of the court.",
        "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\r\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\r\nof the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\r\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\r\noff.",
        "“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\r\nexecuted, whether you’re nervous or not.”\r\n\r\n“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\r\n“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the\r\nbread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”\r\n\r\n“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.",
        "“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.",
        "“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply.",
        "“Do you\r\ntake me for a dunce?",
        "Go on!”\r\n\r\n“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\r\nthat—only the March Hare said—”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.",
        "“You did!” said the Hatter.",
        "“I deny it!” said the March Hare.",
        "“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\r\n\r\n“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\r\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\r\nnothing, being fast asleep.",
        "“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\r\n\r\n“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.",
        "“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.",
        "“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\r\n\r\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\r\ndown on one knee.",
        "“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.",
        "“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.",
        "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\r\nthe officers of the court.",
        "(As that is rather a hard word, I will just\r\nexplain to you how it was done.",
        "They had a large canvas bag, which tied\r\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\r\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\r\n\r\n“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice.",
        "“I’ve so often read in\r\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at\r\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\r\ncourt,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\r\n\r\n“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\r\nKing.",
        "“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”\r\n\r\n“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.",
        "Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.",
        "“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice.",
        "“Now we shall get\r\non better.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\r\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.",
        "“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\r\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.",
        "“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\r\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\r\nto the door.",
        "“Call the next witness!” said the King.",
        "The next witness was the Duchess’s cook.",
        "She carried the pepper-box in\r\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\r\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.",
        "“Give your evidence,” said the King.",
        "“Shan’t,” said the cook.",
        "The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\r\n“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\r\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\r\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”\r\n\r\n“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.",
        "“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.",
        "“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out.",
        "“Behead that Dormouse!",
        "Turn that Dormouse out of court!",
        "Suppress him!",
        "Pinch him!",
        "Off with his\r\nwhiskers!”\r\n\r\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\r\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\r\ndisappeared.",
        "“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief.",
        "“Call the\r\nnext witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my\r\ndear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness.",
        "It quite makes my\r\nforehead ache!”\r\n\r\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\r\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\r\nhaven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself.",
        "Imagine her\r\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\r\nlittle voice, the name “Alice!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.",
        "Alice’s Evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\r\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\r\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\r\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\r\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\r\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.",
        "“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\r\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\r\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\r\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\r\njury-box, or they would die.",
        "“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\r\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\r\nwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.",
        "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\r\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\r\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.",
        "She soon\r\ngot it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\r\nsaid to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\r\ntrial one way up as the other.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\r\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\r\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\r\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\r\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\r\ncourt.",
        "“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.",
        "“Nothing,” said Alice.",
        "“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.",
        "“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.",
        "“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury.",
        "They were\r\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\r\nRabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he\r\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\r\nhe spoke.",
        "“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\r\nto himself in an undertone,\r\n\r\n“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying\r\nwhich word sounded best.",
        "Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\r\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\r\n“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.",
        "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\r\nhis note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\r\nForty-two.",
        "_All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”\r\n\r\nEverybody looked at Alice.",
        "“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.",
        "“You are,” said the King.",
        "“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.",
        "“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\r\nregular rule: you invented it just now.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.",
        "“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.",
        "The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.",
        "“Consider your\r\nverdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.",
        "“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\r\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been\r\npicked up.”\r\n\r\n“What’s in it?” said the Queen.",
        "“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\r\nletter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”\r\n\r\n“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\r\nnobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.",
        "“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s\r\nnothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\r\nand added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”\r\n\r\n“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.",
        "“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\r\nthing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)\r\n\r\n“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King.",
        "(The jury\r\nall brightened up again.)\r\n\r\n“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\r\ncan’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”\r\n\r\n“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\r\nworse.",
        "You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\r\nyour name like an honest man.”\r\n\r\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\r\nclever thing the King had said that day.",
        "“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.",
        "“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice.",
        "“Why, you don’t even know\r\nwhat they’re about!”\r\n\r\n“Read them,” said the King.",
        "The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.",
        "“Where shall I begin, please\r\nyour Majesty?” he asked.",
        "“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you\r\ncome to the end: then stop.”\r\n\r\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:—\r\n\r\n“They told me you had been to her,\r\n    And mentioned me to him:\r\nShe gave me a good character,\r\n    But said I could not swim.",
        "He sent them word I had not gone\r\n    (We know it to be true):\r\nIf she should push the matter on,\r\n    What would become of you?",
        "I gave her one, they gave him two,\r\n    You gave us three or more;\r\nThey all returned from him to you,\r\n    Though they were mine before.",
        "If I or she should chance to be\r\n    Involved in this affair,\r\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\r\n    Exactly as we were.",
        "My notion was that you had been\r\n    (Before she had this fit)\r\nAn obstacle that came between\r\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.",
        "Don’t let him know she liked them best,\r\n    For this must ever be\r\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\r\n    Between yourself and me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the\r\nKing, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”\r\n\r\n“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so\r\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\r\ninterrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence.",
        "_I_ don’t believe there’s\r\nan atom of meaning in it.”\r\n\r\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\r\nan atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\r\npaper.",
        "“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\r\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any.",
        "And yet I don’t\r\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\r\nthem with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.",
        "“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning\r\nto the Knave.",
        "The Knave shook his head sadly.",
        "“Do I look like it?” he said.",
        "(Which he\r\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\r\n\r\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\r\nverses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\r\ncourse—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\r\ndid with the tarts, you know—”\r\n\r\n“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.",
        "“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\r\ntarts on the table.",
        "“Nothing can be clearer than _that_.",
        "Then\r\nagain—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\r\nthink?” he said to the Queen.",
        "“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\r\nas she spoke.",
        "(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\r\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\r\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\r\nas it lasted.)\r\n\r\n“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\r\ncourt with a smile.",
        "There was a dead silence.",
        "“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\r\nlaughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\r\nabout the twentieth time that day.",
        "“No, no!” said the Queen.",
        "“Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\r\n\r\n“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly.",
        "“The idea of having the\r\nsentence first!”\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.",
        "“I won’t!” said Alice.",
        "“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.",
        "Nobody\r\nmoved.",
        "“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\r\nthis time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\r\n\r\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\r\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\r\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\r\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\r\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.",
        "“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\r\nhad!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\r\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\r\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\r\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\r\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\r\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\r\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.",
        "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\r\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\r\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\r\nand this was her dream:—\r\n\r\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\r\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\r\nlooking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\r\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\r\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\r\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\r\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.",
        "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\r\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\r\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\r\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\r\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\r\nwas sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\r\naround it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\r\nLizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\r\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\r\nTurtle.",
        "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\r\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\r\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\r\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\r\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\r\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\r\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\r\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\r\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\r\nTurtle’s heavy sobs.",
        "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\r\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\r\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\r\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\r\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\r\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\r\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\r\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\r\ndays."
